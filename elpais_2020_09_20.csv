2020-09-25, 15:30 UTC,Ten covert police operations that took place under Spain’s PP government,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-25/ten-covert-police-operations-that-took-place-under-spains-popular-party-government.html,"Jorge Fernández Díaz first stepped into his new office inside Spain’s Interior Ministry on December 22, 2011, just a few days after the Popular Party (PP)'s victory at the general election under the leadership of Mariano Rajoy. The first thing that the veteran conservative politician did, even before accepting the leather portfolio from his predecessor, Antonio Camacho of the Socialist Party (PSOE), was to ask an odd question: “Did you guys ever commit any irregularities?” Camacho says that he was surprised at the question, and that he answered no. A few minutes later, Fernández Díaz solemnly made the following statement to reporters: “I want everyone to know that I have evidence that the Interior Ministry has never at any time put the rule of law on hold. And it will not do so in future, either.” Perhaps that was truly his intention, but the fact remains that just a few months later, a series of apocryphal police reports began to emerge disseminating false information about Catalan politicians involved in separatist activities. Over the course of the five years that followed, other similarly covert operations were carried out by a group of high-ranking members of the National Police working for the Interior Ministry under the PP administration, without judicial authorization or oversight. Fernández Díaz, his secretary of state for security Francisco Martínez and half-a-dozen police officials are now the targets of a court investigation into an alleged illegal spying operation against the PP’s former party treasurer Luis Bárcenas. A judge at Spain’s High Court, the Audiencia Nacional, recently lifted the seal on an inquiry into a covert operation paid with fondos reservados – state funds earmarked for national security that are not held up to public scrutiny. Operation Kitchen, as it was codenamed, aimed to find and destroy any incriminating evidence that Bárcenas might be holding against members of the Rajoy administration. Bárcenas was a key figure in a long-running scandal involving allegations of illegal corporate donations and under-the-table cash bonuses for top PP officials, including Rajoy himself. In early 2013, this newspaper revealed the existence of handwritten ledgers, known as los papeles de Bárcenas (the Bárcenas papers), suggesting a parallel bookkeeping system for undeclared party funds. The former treasurer was also found to have millions of euros stashed away in Swiss bank accounts. The Bárcenas case was part of an even larger scandal known as the Gürtel case involving kickbacks, fraud and money laundering. Dozens of people were convicted in May 2018, and the public outcry helped pave the way for a successful no-confidence vote against Rajoy led by Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE). But spying on Bárcenas was just one of the covert operations that went on under Fernández Díaz’s tenure at the Interior Ministry. All the police operations shared several traits: for one, they were never authorized by a judge and therefore there was no judicial oversight; in many cases they fabricated “evidence” against adversaries of the PP executive, then leaked that information to certain media outlets. Sometimes documents against Catalan separatist leaders were obtained through extortion, while other times information that might be damaging to the government would get stolen. EL PAÍS has reconstructed 10 of these operations based on testimony from their victims. 1. Spicing up a report to sink a Catalan premier (October 2012) The Catalan premier at the time, Artur Mas, had called regional elections on November 25, 2012 in the hopes of securing a pro-independence majority. In the months leading up to the polls, some members of the police launched a disinformation campaign using alleged reports that contained serious accusations against Mas and other political leaders. “I woke up one day to a headline in El Mundo claiming that I had money stashed away in Switzerland. It was absolutely false,” says Mas. “I spent the rest of the campaign trying to prove something that I could not prove: my innocence, because it was all a pack of lies. Nobody would believe me. I’m sure it cost us quite a few lawmakers, we lost 12 seats. At a personal level, this was shattering for my father during the last few months of his life.” Mas is convinced that it all happened “with consent from La Moncloa [the seat of Spanish government].” Mas filed a complaint against the newspaper, but the case was shelved. “The judge said that the reporters had contacted the Interior Ministry to determine whether the report was credible, and the reply had been affirmative.” Mas took his case to the European courts, and he is still awaiting a decision. “The feeling you get is that anything goes, that here’s a brazen breach of the rule of law and that the courts, instead of protecting you, shelve the case. It was a campaign run by a political apparatus – the PP – along with a media apparatus and a ‘parapolice’ apparatus,” adds Mas, under whose term in office Catalonia held a non-binding independence vote in November 2014 that predates the unauthorized referendum of October 1, 2017. In early 2017, Mas was tried for disobedience and barred from office for two years for authorizing a vote ruled unconstitutional under Spanish legislation. The charges against Mas were based on a police report that bore no date, no signature and no seal. The resulting scandal led the ministry to launch an internal investigation. The man in charge of the probe, Internal Affairs police chief Marcelino Martín Blas, said the following inside Catalan parliament: “We discovered that the report was a cut-and-paste of other official reports and that somebody, and we never found out who, had added a bit of ‘spice’ to the text by introducing accusations of tax evasion against Mas and others.” None of it turned out to be true. 2. The penthouse that ended a Madrid premier’s career (November 2011-March 2015) Then-interior minister Jorge Fernández Díaz told his top aide Francisco Martínez to go talk to veteran police chief José Manuel Villarejo about a matter that was making life complicated for Ignacio González, a fellow PP politician who was then serving as the deputy premier of the Madrid region. In the fall of 2012, the media reported on a luxury penthouse used by González in Estepona, on Spain’s Costa del Sol, which he and his wife first rented and later purchased at what was described as below market prices. Before that, in November 2011, González himself had met with Villarejo, who is currently at the center of a huge investigation involving 20 years' worth of phone taps, undercover recordings and other invasions of privacy against scores of politicians, business people, judges and journalists. At that 2011 meeting, held inside a cafeteria in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol, Villarejo offered to solve González’s problems. But true to form, Villarejo also secretly recorded the conversation, and produced it four years later, on March 9, 2015, three months ahead of regional elections, in order to ruin González’s political career. The latter had been serving as Madrid premier since September 2012. Villarejo boasted to his friends about having personally caused González’s downfall by deliberately leaking that conversation. Top PP officials were aware of this operation against González, according to Villarejo’s testimony, although they allegedly had last-minute regrets. Eight years after the scandal broke, a judge shelved the case on the basis that there was not enough evidence to prove that someone had gifted the attic to González in exchange for favors. 3. Villarejo’s mission to undermine the Gürtel case (July 2009) Villarejo, who describes himself as an “undercover agent” on his own resume, had been getting jobs from the PP ever since the conservative party began suffering from the effects of the Gürtel case, a sprawling kickbacks-for-contracts scandal that ultimately ended the career of Mariano Rajoy in a no-confidence vote in June 2018. In July 2009, a few months after the case broke, Villarejo met with Dolores de Cospedal, then the party’s secretary general, inside her office at PP headquarters in Madrid. There, he told Cospedal and the latter’s husband, Ignacio López del Hierro, that he and other police officers were at their disposal to obstruct the Gürtel investigation and try to minimize damage to the party. As usual, Villarejo secretly recorded the conversation. “I’ve got my wallet on one side and my heart on the other,” he is heard saying. “My heart is yours. Every time you guys are in power, I never make money, but every time the Socialist Party (PSOE) is in power, they’re so disastrous that they always end up giving me jobs.” Villarejo told Cospedal and her husband of the attempt to eliminate a pen drive in the possession of party treasurer Luis Bárcenas; he also said that top PP officials had been warned ahead of time about impending raids and other operations. López del Hierro is heard saying: “Would you be willing, for instance, to do the occasional job on specific matters?” Cospedal adds: “Don’t worry about discretion issues.” 4. A botched search for Bárcenas' secrets (June 2013-June 2015) Four years after that semi-secret meeting at PP headquarters, Villarejo and Inspector Andrés Gómez Gordo, a former official in the government of Castilla-La Mancha when Cospedal was its regional premier, took charge of Operation Kitchen, which a judicial inquiry has described as an attempt to steal incriminating information from the disgraced PP treasurer Luis Bárcenas. Villarejo and Gómez Gordo persuaded Sergio Rios, Bárcenas’ chauffeur, to work for them. He was paid €2,000 a month between June 2013 and June 2015 to pass on information about where the couple kept sensitive information about the party. In the meantime, nearly 70 officers were sent out to trail Bárcenas’s wife, Rosalía Iglesias. Amateurism was always a significant element in this spying work by the PP’s “political police.” On one occasion, Villarejo tasked Bárcenas’ chauffeur with obtaining the wife’s cellphone number so they could tap it. One day, when Rosalía Iglesias momentarily left the phone inside the car, Ríos grabbed it and placed a call to his own phone, so the number would be registered. But then he did not know how to delete the record of the outgoing call from Iglesias’s device. The chauffeur was eventually offered a position with the National Police as a reward for his efforts. Ultimately, the stolen documents lacked any real relevance, and in any case they were leaked to the media even before a court could get its hands on them. 5. Jordi Pujol’s accounts in Andorra (June 2014) In late 2012, a line of investigation against the family of Jordi Pujol, who served as Catalan premier between 1980 and 2003, made significant headway. The Pujols had already been targeted by ghost reports published by El Mundo with headlines such as: “The Pujols have €137 million in Geneva, according to the police.” But the investigation really came together when María Victoria Álvarez, a former girlfriend of the eldest son, also named Jordi Pujol, told the police what she personally knew about the family’s accounts in Andorra, a microstate between Spain and France that is considered a tax haven. She later gave the same information to a judge. The police were on the case but the money had not turned up. Then, in the spring of 2014, officers working under Eugenio Pino, who was the head of the police department Dirección Adjunta Operativa (DAO) and a high-ranking official within the Interior Ministry, decided to target Banca Privada d’Andorra (BPA). Bank executives were told to cooperate with information about the Pujols’ accounts or prepare for action against the lender’s Spanish affiliate, Banco de Madrid, according to testimony from the bank owners. Joan Pau Miquel, the CEO of BPA, met with Internal Affairs police chief Marcelino Martín Blas at Villamagna Hotel in Madrid in June 2014, and handed him a slip of paper showing a bank account, the names of Jordi Pujol, his wife Marta Ferrusola and one of their daughters, and several amounts. Another police officer who went to Andorra managed to save a screenshot of the Pujols’ account, showing a balance of €3.4 million. But Pino did not go straight to the judge with the information, which was published a few days later by El Mundo. Jordi Pujol was forced to admit two weeks later that he had funds in foreign bank accounts, leading to a public scandal. A former Banco de Madrid official remembers those events: “The police did not believe that that’s all there was [the money]; they believed there was over €100 million and that the bank was not cooperating fully. In the middle of that pressure, somebody informed US authorities about alleged money laundering at BPA”. In March 2015, the FinCen [the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the US Treasury Department, an anti-money-laundering unit] named BPA “a foreign financial institution of primary money-laundering concern” based on information suggesting that it “knowingly facilitated transactions on behalf of third-party money launderers acting on behalf of transnational criminal organizations.” That same month, the Bank of Spain stepped in to take control of Banco de Madrid and the latter has since been involved in insolvency procedures. “They took down a bank in good financial health for nothing,” says the same ex-official. They based it on a report by Sepblac [Executive Service of the Committee for Prevention and Money Laundering, which answers to the Economy Ministry] that was inconsistent and leaked to the media. There were four trials and nothing was ever proven. The US later pulled its own report. More than 200 employees lost their jobs; we went to court and were told to pay the legal fees. They covered things up. It was injustice on a galactic scale.” Bank executives took legal action in Andorra against police officials over coercion claims in a case that is still open. 6. The non-existent Swiss account that brought down the mayor of Barcelona (October 2014) In late 2014, the situation in Catalonia became tense again when the regional government headed by Artur Mas announced an unauthorized independence referendum for November 9 of that year. Before that, on October 2 and 16, Jorge Fernández Díaz had met with Catalonia’s anti-fraud chief, Daniel de Alfonso, inside the former’s office. The conversation was recorded with the minister’s authorization (as he himself later admitted) and it was revealed in 2016 by the online daily Público. At this meeting, both men conspired to set up a new operation against the mayor of Barcelona at the time, Xavier Trias of the moderately nationalist coalition Convergence and Union (CiU), now defunct. Fernández Díaz and De Alfonso discussed an alleged Swiss bank account held by Trias, and noted how well the operation against Jordi Pujol had turned out. Just days later, on October 27, El Mundo ran a story about an alleged Swiss bank account in Trias’s name holding €12.9 million. “It was totally false. It happened six months before the municipal elections of May 2015. My wife said to me, ‘No matter what you manage to prove, the damage is done, you’ve lost the election.’ And so it was,” recalls Trias. “The most astounding thing is that, at the time, the parties did not do much about it. Later, when more information began to emerge about the cesspit of the state, they did, but when it happened to me, nobody paid attention.” Three days later, the Swiss bank UBS sent a statement denying the veracity of the claim: they did not have a client with that name, and the account number did not match any at the lender. The Spanish police, who presumably leaked the document in the first place, then filed a complaint with prosecutors, but the claim was shelved. A top police aide travelled to Switzerland to find out why they’d been given false information, but came back empty-handed. Trias took legal action against El Mundo but lost the case. “The judge said that the reporters were not to blame because the source was credible: it was the Interior Ministry.” “It seems unreal that such things can happen under a rule of law. They say: ‘We’re going to take this guy down,’ they achieve their goal, and nothing happens.” 7. Media weapons to politically destroy Podemos (January 2016) At the general election of December 2015, Podemos secured 69 seats and became the third-largest force in the lower house of parliament, the Congress of Deputies. Its lawmakers were now in a position to obstruct the formation of a new PP government. Just a few days later, DAO chief Eugenio Pino, who was as loyal to the interior minister as the latter was to Mariano Rajoy, ordered his most trusted officers to send the Audit Court a damning report on Podemos and its leader, Pablo Iglesias. The report bore no signature, its authorship was unclear, and it appeared to have been hastily put together. Just 23 days after the elections, it was published by the online daily Ok Diario, which claimed that a police document proved that the Iranian government had funded Iglesias’ political career. Manos Limpias, a union created by far-right figure Miguel Bernad, used this document as the basis for filing a crime report that was shelved. Weeks later, the police used the same document to file a complaint with the Audit Court, which also shelved it. Pablo Iglesias says that he spoke on several occasions with Fernández Díaz and the latter always said he had nothing to do with it. “He wasn’t going to say ‘yes, as a matter of fact I’ve sent some guys over to tear you to pieces,’” notes Iglesias in conversation. “One of the chief characteristics of the report against me is how crudely it was crafted. Not even the most receptive judge could possibly have taken it into account as evidence. The goal was not to put me in jail, since they had obtained no proof of any illegal activities. The so-called PISA report [for Pablo Iglesias S. A., but also a play on the international educational assessment report] was meant to provide fodder to tabloids and even allegedly respectable media outlets in order to establish a lingering lie about illegal financing by Podemos.” Iglesias underscored the media value of the police operation that targeted him. “Villarejo built up his media clout. This police officer is who he is thanks to his contacts in the media world, and it is unacceptable that we should take in stride statements such as ‘a journalist’s job is to meet individuals like Villarejo over dinner.’ I think that signals the beginning of the end of democracy.” The campaign was not solely aimed at Iglesias. Another Podemos leader, Juan Carlos Monedero, recalls how he was the target of the same strategy. “False reports get drafted by the state apparatus and leaked to specific media outlets to create a social construct about you being a criminal. At one point I was dealing with up to 12 private criminal complaints, and for three days there were reporters stationed outside my house 24/7. In the end all the complaints got shelved, but it doesn’t matter, people already think that you are a criminal.” Monedero adds that it was a very intense period in his life. “They create a very hostile environment and point you out as though you were public enemy number one. And the only thing you’ve done is found a party that might hurt them. Yes, there was a moment when they managed to rattle me.” 8. A “new life” for a former minister of Venezuela in exchange for evidence against Iglesias (April 2016) On the first week of April 2016, the online dailies El Confidencial and Ok Diario ran stories saying that Venezuela had paid €7 million to Podemos leaders Pablo Iglesias and Juan Carlos Monedero, and to Jorge Verstrynge, a former politician and political scientist who helped found the party. The latter recalls that at first he dismissed the story, but later became concerned. “Someone from intelligence [services] warned me that they were going after Pablo,” he says. “[The source] said that they were going to metaphorically kill him. I warned him. He had been expecting it.” The news story was based on an alleged document signed by Rafael Isea, a former finance minister under Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez. Three officers from the Spanish National Police travelled to New York a few days later to meet with Isea to verify the authenticity of the document. The meeting took place inside the Spanish consulate, and the police officers, who said they represented the government, promised to get Isea’s family out of Venezuela and offer them “a new life” in exchange for testimony against Podemos. A police officer named Fuentes Gago reportedly said: “If you help us prevent the Podemos people from making it [to power], goddammit, it will be better for everyone.” Chávez’s former minister agreed to the deal despite noticing odd things about the document: “I don’t usually write in that style; the dates and names didn’t sound familiar, and nobody ever used Chávez’s second surname,” recalls Isea. A month after that meeting, his statement appeared in print in the conservative newspaper Abc, but the promises vanished. In June 2019, Isea told his story to EL PAÍS: “They manipulated me with a very delicate matter, they placed my family at risk. For several months I was under tough pressure, waiting for the reaction by the Venezuelan government. That is why I never spoke up until now. We’re talking about lives at stake. We’re talking about an 80-year-old lady whom I can’t even see. I trusted in a government that told me it could get my mother out of there.” But Isea never again heard from the police officers who had made that promise. 9. A phony payment order in the Grenadine islands (May 2016)In May 2016, the police leaked information to Ok Diario regarding a payment order worth $272,325 (€229,000) made by the Venezuela government to the name of Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias at a branch office of Euro Pacific Bank in the Grenadine islands. The date on the order, March 11, 2014, coincided with the date when Podemos registered to run in the European elections of May 25, 2014. A Venezuelan citizen named Carlos Alberto Arias secured a residency permit from the Spanish Interior Ministry in exchange for cooperating with the police by producing documents regarding payments by the Venezuelan executive to Podemos and Pablo Iglesias, as Arias himself later admitted. The document turned out to be phony, as confirmed by the Euro Pacific Bank. 10. A telephone theft turns into a smear campaign (June 2016) Dina Bousselham, an advisor to Pablo Iglesias in the European Parliament, filed a police report on November 1, 2015 stating that her cellphone had been stolen. Two months later, the phone’s memory card, which contained sensitive information, made it to the newsroom of Interviú magazine, allegedly inside an envelope with no return address. The card ended up in the hands of the police chief Villarejo, who asked the magazine director to hand it over because, as he said, his bosses at the Interior Ministry were interested in its contents. The contents that were most likely to damage Iglesias’ reputation – some sexist remarks he made about a female reporter – were published in Ok Diario a few days after Villarejo, as his agenda reflects, had met with reporters from that media outlet. Villarejo, who has been in preventive prison since 2017, has been charged in connection with that incident. “What really makes Villarejo great is that he is a media professional,” notes Iglesias. “What we went through was not the cesspit’s ability to produce fake evidence, but its tremendous ability to produce fake news. A disregard for the truth has become the norm, not the exception. I think that in the media wars, a wartime logic has been adopted in that anything goes; the goal of the headline, of the conversation topic, is never to see the truth or the facts in a specific manner, but to wage war on the adversary. And that leaves our democracy in a very vulnerable position.” English version by Susana Urra. ","['José Manuel Romero', 'Pablo Ordaz', 'Iñigo Domínguez', 'El País']"
2020-09-25, 11:56 UTC,Madrid extends coronavirus restrictions on mobility to eight new areas and recommends residents stay at home,society,/society/2020-09-25/madrid-extends-coronavirus-restrictions-on-mobility-to-eight-new-areas-and-recommends-residents-stay-at-home.html,"The Madrid regional government announced on Friday that it will extend the coronavirus mobility restrictions that currently affect 37 basic health areas in the region to eight new zones. Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, Madrid’s deputy health chief Antonio Zapatero said the move was aimed at “stopping the spread of the coronavirus” in the region, which has the highest incidence rate of Covid-19 in Spain, with 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The restrictions will be applied to eight basic health areas – a unit that is much smaller than a city district and can include several primary healthcare centers – that have an incidence rate of more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The affected areas are Panaderas (Fuenlabrada); Miguel Servet and Doctor Tueta (Alcorcón); García Noblejas, Vicálvaro-Artilleros, Orcasitas, Campo de la Paloma and Rafael Alberti (Madrid city). From Monday, residents in these areas will only be able to leave the restricted zones for essential business, such as going to school or work, or to care for dependents. Capacity at stores and other commercial establishments will be set at 50% and closing time at 10pm with the exception of pharmacies, gas stations and health centers. Bar service will be prohibited and public parks in the affected zones will also be closed. The measures will come into effect on Monday and last for at least two weeks. A total of 45 health areas, which are home to more than one million residents, have now been confined. Residents who break the restrictions on mobility could face fines of between €600 and €600,000, according to the current health protocols. But authorities have said that police will not issue fines until the Madrid High Court has ratified the health department’s order. Zapatero also recommended that all residents in the Madrid region stay at home: “Our main concern is slowing the virus. We are recommending that all non-essential travel be avoided.” In an unusual turn of events, Health Minister Salvador Illa held an unexpected press conference at the same time that Zapatero was speaking, announcing that he had expected more ambitious measures from the Madrid government, such as reducing the capacity at sidewalk cafes across the region. Illa also called on the Madrid government to confine all areas with an incidence rate above 500 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. According to data released by the Madrid government on Tuesday, 16 health areas have an incidence rate above 1,000 cases. Despite this, only eight of these zones have been placed under the new restrictions. There has been friction between the Madrid region and the central government since the state of alarm was introduced back in March. Regional premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso of the conservative Popular Party (PP) was highly critical of the suspension of her government’s powers during the emergency period and had demanded they be returned. Since June, however, when the state of alarm ended and the regions were put in charge of controlling the epidemic, the epidemiological situation has quickly worsened in Madrid, prompting Ayuso to do a U-turn and call on the central government to intervene. An uneasy peace appeared to have been reached between the Madrid premier and Socialist Party Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday when they held a meeting and agreed to work together to deal with the situation in Madrid. The divisions on display on Friday, however, suggest that peace has been shattered. Asked by journalists as to the spirit with which the next coordination meeting between the central government and the Madrid administration will be held, given that the latter has not taken the advice of the former, Illa said at his press conference on Friday that it would “always be with the constructive spirit of loyalty, but with great clarity, with the aim of taking control of the epidemic.” Illa was also asked as to what would need to happen for the government to take control of the Madrid region. “The responsibility at this time for taking measures clearly corresponds to the Madrid region,” he answered. “I have explained the measures that we have recommended, and the government wants them to be known about by citizens in an exercise of transparency.” Zapatero, meanwhile, argued that the decision to confine areas cannot be solely based on transmission rates, as this figure “is closely related to diagnostic capacity. That’s why we monitor other data.” The Madrid regional government has not ruled out introducing further measures in the coming weeks, such as ordering all commercial establishments in the region to close by 10pm – not just in the 45 health areas under selective confinement. In the rest of the Madrid region, stores can open until 1am (unless they are licensed to close earlier), bars and restaurants can operate at 75% capacity and bar counters are at 50% capacity. As of mid-August, nightclubs and nighttime bars across Spain have been closed. A spike in outbreaks over the summer months after powers to control the epidemic had been fully restored to the regions evidenced that the Madrid government had not prepared sufficiently for a second wave despite pledges to do so during the deescalation process. Doctors from 62 of the region’s hospitals claim 95% of intensive care units (ICUs) are occupied by Covid-19 patients, the region’s primary healthcare system is stretched to the limit, and there are still not enough contact tracers to manage the crisis. With more than 100,000 new infections since August 1 in the Madrid region, and 3,215 coronavirus patients in its hospitals, the regional administration is once again staring into the abyss of a combined health, economic and social crisis. According to experts, measures introduced so far by the Madrid region have arrived too late, and many believe that the lockdown of the entire city will be inevitable in just a few days.

2020-09-25, 06:45 UTC,"Spain reports 10,653 new coronavirus cases but overall incidence falls slightly",society,/society/2020-09-25/spain-reports-10653-new-coronavirus-cases-but-overall-incidence-falls-slightly.html,"The incidence of the coronavirus in Spain, which has been rising non-stop for the last two weeks, has eased off slightly. According to the latest government figures, which were released on Thursday evening by the Health Ministry, 10,653 new infections were detected, bringing the official count since the pandemic began to more than 700,000. But the rate of new infections over the last 14 days has fallen from 287.7 per 100,000 inhabitants on Tuesday to 283.3 on Thursday. This fall may not be a trend, given that rises and falls are common. The data from the coming days will be necessary to determine the direction in which the curve is moving. Much of the fall in infections is due to the data reported from Madrid, which during this second wave of the coronavirus has once again become the epicenter of the health crisis in Spain and has seen accelerated growth in infections over recent weeks. While it has seen two days of moderation in its figures, it continues to be the worst-hit area of Spain, with 746.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. It is followed by the northern regions of Navarre, with 658.8, La Rioja, with 466.9 and Castilla-La Mancha, with 416.8. Speaking to reporters on Thursday evening, the secretary of state for health, Silvia Calzón, pointed out that regions that have previously seen high rates of infection have managed to lower them, and vice versa. The best example of this is the Basque Country, which has been bringing down its figures for two weeks marking what appears to be a clear trend. According to Thursday’s ministry report, 9.5% of Spain’s hospital beds are currently occupied by Covid-19 patients, as are 17% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. This percentage has not been calculated based on the normal total of beds, but rather all of those that have been made available to deal with the health crisis, the use of which means changes in the normal working of the country’s hospitals. In Madrid, for example, the ministry has cited ICU occupation rates at 38.93%, but a network of doctors from 62 of the region’s hospitals claim that the figure for regular ICU beds is actually at 95%. The knock-on effect of this is that many routine operations cannot be carried out. Thursday’s report added 84 new Covid-19 victims to the official death toll. Over the last two weeks, the average number of deaths has come in at more than 100 a day, bringing the total to 31,118 since the start of the crisis. However, the real figure is likely to be much higher, given that during the first wave many people died without having been diagnosed. English version by Simon Hunter. ",['Pablo Linde']
2020-09-25, 07:12 UTC,"Nearly 3,000 classes in Spain forced to quarantine since beginning of school year ",society,/society/2020-09-25/nearly-3000-classes-in-spain-forced-to-quarantine-since-beginning-of-school-year.html,"The coronavirus has forced students of all ages from 2,852 classrooms across Spain to go into quarantine since the beginning of the school year, according to data provided by regional authorities to the Education Ministry. This represents less than 1% of the total, but the percentage of affected classes varies greatly between Spain’s 17 regions. Education authorities say that the number of classes in quarantine is at a manageable level where schools can continue to operate relatively normally, given the exceptional circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. But the confinement of classes is a serious problem for thousands of families. Only a few regions have responded to EL PAÍS’s questions about how many students have been affected, and the Education Ministry has not yet offered a total figure. But if an average class has 15 students, which is a conservative estimate, it means that more than 40,000 students have been quarantined since the beginning of the school year. This includes pupils of all ages, including teenagers who can stay home alone and study remotely with relative guarantees of success. But many other students are small children who need to be looked after by a parent or adult during their isolation period. This has led to difficulties with parents’ work and sparked concerns about the impact of quarantines on children’s education. “In my case, it has been disruptive because both of us work,” says Carme Domènech, the mother of a six-year-old student at a public school in Valencia who has been in quarantine since Wednesday. “I work remotely and my husband has the afternoon shift, so only part of my working day is affected, when I have to juggle my job with my role as mother.” While Domènech says that she is much less productive because of the situation, she recognizes that “there are worse cases in the class,” such as parents who have to work in offices and do not know whether they can ask for sick leave. “And I am also worried about my daughter’s education, especially since I think this is going to happen again and this will not be a normal school year,” says Domènech, who works as an accountant. Regional authorities believe that the number of classes in quarantine is at a reasonable level. In some regions, such as Navarre and Aragón, authorities point out that classes that were placed in isolation when schools first reopened have now begun to return. Others, such as the Basque Country, say the rate of quarantined classes has slowed down. And in general, education authorities say the goal is still to maintain the greatest number of face-to--face classes possible. This is despite the fact that restrictions may be introduced in other social contexts if the virus continues to spread. Based on available information, which has largely come from other countries that reopened schools before summer or at the beginning of August, public health experts such as Salvador Peiró believe that schools are unlikely to be major hotspots for transmission. But schools are not islands, and if a region has a high transmission rate, this is likely to be reflected in its schools, explains Peiró, who is a member of Fisabio, a health research foundation run by the regional government of Valencia. This could make it difficult for schools to continue the normal academic year as planned. For example, the Madrid region, which has the highest incidence rate of Covid-19 in Spain, also has the highest number of classes in quarantine since the beginning of the school year. Last Friday, 168 classes were in isolation, a figure that jumped to 832 on Wednesday. EL PAÍS asked regional authorities for the number of classes that have been quarantined since schools reopened. Only 13 replied. None of them specified the age of the students, and only a few of them indicated the number of affected classes as a percentage of the total. In Madrid, 832 classes have been quarantined (1.4% of the total) since students returned to school. The region with the second-highest number of quarantined classes is Catalonia with 602, followed by the Basque Country (268, 1.5%), Castilla-La Mancha (180, 1%), Andalusia (168, 0.2%), Aragón (148, 1.7%), Navarre (142), Castilla y León (141, 1%), Valencia (130, 0.3%), Extremadura (73), the Balearic Islands (49, 0.7%), La Rioja (33) and Galicia (27). The difference is a reflection of several factors. First, the transmission rate of the disease varies greatly between the regions: in Madrid, the 14-day cumulative incidence of Covid-19 was 742.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 114.4 in Galicia, according to Tuesday’s epidemiological report. Secondly, some regions delayed the start of the school year, with some classes returning up to two weeks later than others. And lastly, some regions update their figures every day while others do so every week: in Andalusia and Valencia, for example, the latest figures are from Monday. Regional authorities in the Canary Islands, Asturias and Cantabria did not reply to EL PAÍS’s request. Murcia only offered the number of students and teachers in quarantine, 187 and 43 respectively, but not the number of classes. In the case of Madrid, unions argue that transmission rates in schools are higher than what is being reported by the regional government in the official statistics. English version by Melissa Kitson.

2020-09-25, 07:37 UTC,"As Madrid is offered 7,500 military personnel to combat coronavirus spread, experts consider what has gone wrong in the region",society,/society/2020-09-25/as-madrid-is-offered-7500-military-personnel-to-combat-coronavirus-spread-experts-consider-what-has-gone-wrong-in-the-region.html,"The rapid spread of the second wave of the coronavirus in Madrid prompted the Spanish government on Thursday to offer the regional administration 7,500 members of the military for assistance with contact tracing, disinfection and logistics. Also on the table for use by the Popular Party-run regional government are assistance from the Carlos III Health Institute and the Health Ministry’s Coordination Center for Health Alerts (CCAES). “Tough weeks are coming for Madrid, and as such we have to act with determination to take control of the pandemic in this region,” warned Health Minister Salvador Illa on Thursday, the day before the regional premier, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, is due to confirm whether current restriction in place that affect more than 850,000 Madrileños will be extended to other areas. “The situation in Madrid is bad,” was the message that emerged from a meeting on Thursday between Illa, several other ministers, and key Socialist Party (PSOE) figures from the region. “A wider lockdown and new measures cannot be ruled out. Now we have to fight together, with loyalty and support for the Madrid government.” Since the first wave of the coronavirus in Spain, which took hold in March, there has been friction between the PP administration in the Madrid region – which is run in coalition with center-right Ciudadanos (Citizens) and propped up by far-right Vox – and the PSOE-run central government, which is also a coalition with leftist junior partner Unidas Podemos. During the state of alarm implemented by Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, regional premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso regularly called for her government’s powers to be returned. In June, with the end of the state of alarm, this took place. Since the second wave of the coronavirus took hold, however, with Madrid once again becoming the epicenter of the epidemic, her government has been calling for the central administration to intervene. With more than 100,000 new infections since August 1 in the Madrid region, and 3,215 coronavirus patients in its hospitals, the regional administration is once again staring into the abyss of a combined health, economic and social crisis. Since Monday, the residents of 37 basic healthcare areas – spread across six districts in the capital and another seven municipalities across the region – have seen their mobility limited to going to work, study or the doctors. Parks and gardens have been sealed off, while all establishments must close by 10pm. Will this be sufficient to content the spread of the virus? The regional government, which opted for a “surgical” intervention rather than a new state of alarm, believes it will not. It is currently considering imposing restrictions in another seven municipalities, given that they now meet the requisite of having more than 1,000 infections per 100,000 inhabitants over the last 14 days. According to experts, these measures have arrived too late, and many believe that the lockdown of the entire city will be inevitable in just a few days. Here are their views on the key issues for Madrid. 37 confined areas. Experts consulted for this article believe that the perimetric confinement of 37 zones has two problems. Firstly, that it should have been implemented earlier, when the incidence of the virus was not so high. Secondly, and related to the first point, contagion is now so widespread that “the incidence rate is extremely high in the whole city and region,” according to Ildefonso Hernández, the spokesperson for the Spanish Public Health Society (Sepsas). “There are few places with under 300 cases per 100,000 inhabitants,” he says. “That means that nearly the entire region needs extensive measures.” In addition, there are doubts about the effectiveness of a lockdown with so many exceptions. The restricted areas are low income and few people who live there can work from home, meaning that people are constantly coming and going, and often using public transport to do so. Police checks. Even if these measures were considered to be effective, a selective lockdown requires police checks. It is clear that Madrid does not have enough officers to monitor that all journeys are justified. The regional government has requested the help of 222 police officers and civil guards for inspections and the levying of fines. Closure of parks. None of the epidemiologists consulted can understand the decision to close parks in areas with high population density, while at the same time leaving open bars and restaurants – albeit with reduced capacity. Hernández admits that such open spaces can be areas where people interact, and as such there is a risk of infection. But he argues that they merely need to be monitored. “This is the open air and everything is visible,” he argues. “We can’t see inside betting houses,” he adds, in reference to another sector that has not been closed by the regional government. “Will officers be going inside to check [that the rules are being observed]?” he asks. Public transportation. As well as the errors and bad decisions taken by the Madrid government, the experts also point to measures that are missing. Epidemiologist Jesús Molina Cabrillana was shocked to see images this week of the deputy premier of Madrid, Ignacio Aguado of Ciudadanos, inaugurating a hand-sanitizer dispenser in the Madrid Metro – six months after the state of alarm was first declared. “I want to see them increase the frequency of trains at rush hour in order to reduce the overcrowding and ensure safe distancing,” he says. “That is more important.” Quarantines. The Madrid region is carrying out nearly 15,000 PCR tests every day, and currently has the worst positivity rate in Spain: 23% of tests are confirming a coronavirus infection, practically one in every four. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that this percentage needs to be below 5% to consider an epidemic to be under control. What’s more, with plans to carry out mass testing, the number of positives is going to rise. Will all of these people be able to quarantine according to the guidelines? Will their close contacts be able to self-isolate? The plan for the Madrid region so far does not include setting up dozens of medicalized hotels, as was done during the first wave, nor other installations that can function as a “Noah’s Ark” for the people who need a place to quarantine if they cannot do so in their home. Mass-testing infrastructure. Díaz Ayuso announced this week that mass testing would begin for the more than 850,000 inhabitants of the 37 confined areas. But she did not explain how so many diagnoses would be carried out in just a few days, and the fact that her government requested “urgent military support” from the central administration on Wednesday suggests that there was no plan in place. As such, these tests will be delayed until next week. Defense Minister Margarita Robles on Thursday offered 7,500 members of the military to Madrid, but said that assistance had still not been formally requested. Medical staff from the region’s primary healthcare system have for weeks been calling for PCR tests to be carried out in tents or other mobile units, rather than in healthcare centers themselves. This is particularly necessary in the case of the locked down areas, where healthcare centers are already overwhelmed. “They should be done in points that are independent from healthcare centers and by professionals that do not belong to primary healthcare staff,” says José María Molero, from the Madrid Family Medicine Society. “The results should be directly conveyed to citizens. If the result is negative, instructions should be given that no follow up is needed. For positive cases, the same system should recommend 10-day isolation and attention at primary healthcare in the case of symptoms or if the person needs time off work.” English version by Simon Hunter.

2020-09-24, 10:14 UTC,Spanish government to consider pardon requests for jailed Catalan separatists,politics,/politics/catalonia_independence/2020-09-24/spanish-government-to-consider-pardon-requests-for-jailed-catalan-separatists.html,"The Spanish government will next week begin considering requests for clemency filed on behalf of Catalan separatist politicians and activists serving prison terms for their role in the the unilateral breakaway attempt of October 2017. According to sources in the Justice Ministry, the first request was filed in January by a Barcelona lawyer named Francesc Jufresa, who petitioned the government to pardon nine individuals convicted to between nine and 13 years in prison after being found guilty of sedition by Spain’s Supreme Court. News of the upcoming review was unexpectedly delivered on Wednesday by Spanish Justice Minister Juan Carlos Campo in response to a question asked by Laura Borrás, the spokesperson in the Congress of Deputies for the separatist party Together for Catalonia (JuntsxCat), which holds eight seats in Spain’s lower house of parliament. The announcement, which Borrás described as “a surprise bombshell,” was received coolly by Catalonia’s independence movement, whose leaders noted that government pardons are considered on an individual basis and that in any case, these would not lead to any meaningful progress on the political front. “Our position on the [Spanish] state’s siren calls is that they are not the solution to the political conflict,” said Albert Batet, the leader of JuntsxCat in the Catalan parliament. The news comes as the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision confirming whether Catalonia’s regional premier Quim Torra will be removed from office for violating electoral legislation in March 2019. The Justice Ministry warned that the review process for government pardons “usually takes more than six months.” The same sources explained that the first request was being considered now, nine months after being filed, due to “delays caused by a backlog of requests during the time that Spain had an acting government.” Spain was under a caretaker administration for 254 days following the inconclusive election of April 2019, which led to a repeat election in November. Parties on the right of the political spectrum reacted angrily to the justice minister’s unexpected disclosure. Both the Popular Party (PP) and the far-right Vox have warned that if the government pardons the imprisoned leaders of the secessionist movement, they will mount legal challenges. Both parties said the move is linked to the fact that the minority government of Pedro Sánchez, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), is currently in talks to secure congressional support for a new budget, and may seek backing from Catalan separatist lawmakers in Spanish Congress. Sources within the PP leadership said that the pardons are “part of the price that Sánchez is paying for his investiture and for the budget,” alluding to the fact that Sánchez was voted back into the prime minister’s office following the November election partly thanks to the Catalan Republican Left (ERC), a separatist group that agreed to abstain at the second round in exchange for opening talks between the central and Catalan governments regarding the situation in Catalonia. These sources added that the Justice Ministry’s push to review the crimes of sedition and rebellion in Spain’s criminal code will also “work in favor of those convicted for 1-O [October 1, 2017, the date of the unauthorized independence referendum].” Meanwhile, Vox’s secretary general in Congress, Macarena Olona, warned that her party will take all necessary legal action “if the government decides to pardon the separatist prisoners convicted for the coup of October 1, 2017.” Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo noted that the Justice Ministry is constitutionally obligated to process any official requests for pardons. Such requests must first undergo review by the court that handed down the conviction, in this case the Supreme Court, but its views are not binding. Pardons are granted by the king at the suggestion of the justice minister following a debate by the Cabinet. Other clemency requests have been filed this year on behalf of two convicted leaders of the breakaway attempt. In late August, the ministry received a petition from three former speakers of Catalan parliament asking the central government to pardon Carme Forcadell, who was the Catalan parliament speaker at the time of the failed attempt to break away from Spain. Forcadell was sentenced to eleven-and-a-half years for sedition. And in June, the Catalan branch of labor union UGT requested clemency for Dolors Bassa, who was the Catalan chief of labor and social affairs in 2017, and is now serving a twelve-year prison term. The other separatist leaders convicted for their involvement in the breakaway attempt are: Oriol Junqueras, the leader of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party; ex-Catalan government ministers Josep Rull, Joaquim Forn, Raül Romeva and Jordi Turull; and Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart, the leaders of the civil society groups Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Òmnium Cultural.

2020-09-24, 10:16 UTC,"Spanish Supreme Court rules food-delivery riders are employees, not self-employed",economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-24/spanish-supreme-court-rules-food-delivery-riders-are-employees.html,"The Spanish Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that food-delivery riders are employees, not self-employed workers. The decision was made in a case brought to court by a former worker for Glovo, the most popular food delivery service in Spain along with Deliveroo. “The relationship that exists between a rider and the Glovo business is of a professional nature,” the Supreme Court said in a statement. This is the first time that the Supreme Court has issued a ruling on the working relationship between food-delivery riders and digital platforms such as these. Glovo is one of the many companies to take advantage of what is known in the United States and the United Kingdom as the “gig economy,” a term that refers to workers who are self-employed and work temporary, flexible jobs such as, in this case, delivering food from a range of establishments to customers, or drive for transportation firms such as Uber, or deliver parcels for e-commerce giants such as Amazon. Although the text of the Supreme Court sentence is still not known, the decision could have far-reaching consequences for the entire gig economy. The court found that Glovo was “not a mere intermediary” between restaurants and delivery riders, but instead “a business that fixes the conditions for the provision of its services, and owns the assets essential to carrying out its services,” the court said. These “assets” include the cellphone application, which riders must have if they are to find work. The decision marks an important step forward in a long legal battle in which several lower courts have ruled in favor of food delivery riders, only to be overturned by higher regional courts. This specific case reached the Supreme Court after Isaac Cuende, a former Glovo worker, appealed a ruling by Madrid’s High Court, which found that food-delivery riders were self-employed workers. In a bid to unify the court’s response on this issue, the head of Madrid’s High Court decided to send the next related case to all 17 magistrates in the Labor Division. In this instance, the judges found that food-delivery riders were employees. The ruling comes at an important time for two reasons: on one hand it coincides with the ongoing controversy over the contradictory sentences on riders’ working status, and on the other, amid government plans to further regulate the sector. In recent years, some workers hired to deliver goods via apps such as Glovo have been demanding recognition as salaried staff and petitioning for the corresponding rights, such as sick leave and paid holidays. Glovo said in a statement it respected the court’s ruling, but expected the government and the European Union to set up a regulatory framework. “Glovo firmly believes this regulation must be promoted based on dialogue between all actors involved,” the statement said.

2020-09-14, 06:45 UTC,Economic physiotherapy,opinion,/opinion/2020-09-14/economic-physiotherapy.html,"No, the worst of the crisis is not yet to come. We soccer players know that the recovery after the dreaded rupture of the knee’s anterior cruciate ligament can be very long, but the worst moment is when you tore it, the sharp pain, the realization that your life is going to change for a long while, the fear that you may never regain your previous power and speed. Physiotherapy is slow, tedious and long, but the daily progress shows the light at the end of the tunnel. The economy is now entering that physiotherapy process. The worst is over, the initial fear of an invisible and novel virus, the sudden disappearance of customers, the overnight spike in unemployment, the emptying of the streets. In these months we have learned to better manage the virus and mitigate its effects. The economy has been brought back to life again. Of course, success will depend on managing the recovery well, there is no room for excuses or complacency. From now on, if economic policy is adequate, if all the necessary resources are provided, if the relapses of the pandemic are well managed, the process of improvement will continue, weathering the storm until the medical solutions allow restrictions to be removed. It is also the time to reflect on the lessons learned. One of the keys to crisis management is getting the diagnosis right. Fortunately, the initial temptation to define this crisis as a supply problem in the face of which monetary and fiscal policy could do little quickly disappeared. Defining this crisis as an induced economic coma, and not a recession, has allowed for the adoption of a different strategy. The concern with moral hazard has been set aside, and two simple but effective rules have been adopted as a general principle of action – unconditional support (graduated by sector according to restrictions) for incomes, employment and liquidity while restrictions are in place, and an expansionary fiscal policy until the 2019 gross domestic product (GDP) levels are restored. Policy coherence will be critical: let’s not forget the outsized negative impact of the 2014 tax hike in Japan. This new strategy will avoid a repetition of the aftermath of the 2007 crisis. The obsession with reducing the deficit and debt at all costs has been put on hold, placing the emphasis on activating the fastest possible recovery. It is the paradox of risk taken to its maximum expression: if the public sector assumes more risk, in an intelligent way, the economy recovers faster and better, and total vulnerability decreases. In a typical recession, it may make sense to encourage the rapid reallocation of resources and the fast liquidation of insolvent companies. In an induced economic coma the recipe is the opposite, the life of the productive fabric must be prolonged until the necessary restrictions are eliminated, normality is restored, and the market can perform its triaging role. The public sector has to act as the investor of last resort, and be willing to assume the risk of losses to ensure that the temporary lack of liquidity of the private sector doesn’t turn into insolvency. It is the public sector fulfilling its traditional role of insurer of last resort in the face of a systemic shock. That is why several European countries have already decided to extend the short term work schemes until 2021. That is why, in the United States, there are proposals to graduate the amount of unemployment benefits in proportion to the unemployment rate – the higher the unemployment, the higher the amount. Empirical evidence in the US shows that the recent increase in unemployment benefits has not altered incentives to seek employment. Workers, logically, prefer stable employment to improved unemployment benefits, as employment reduces uncertainty. This crisis has given another twist to the dilemma between efficiency and resilience. There is no doubt that improving efficiency through, for example, market liberalization, globalization, or offshoring, is the key to increasing productivity. But the 2007 crisis already gave a first warning about the need to balance efficiency and resilience in the financial sector. The Fukushima disaster in 2011 sharpened the focus on the risks of offshoring and global production chains. There is mounting empirical evidence showing that predistribution increases stability and, therefore, efficiency. Covid-19 has suddenly awakened health nationalism – remember the initial restrictions on masks exports. The precariousness and lack of capacity of some hospital systems indicates that, in some countries, the search for efficiency in healthcare spending had perhaps been taken too far. But beware of using resilience as an argument to protect, in a populist and inefficient way, certain sectors. Industrial policy is a dangerous double-edged sword. The period of physiotherapy should also be used to increase strength and resilience. The context could not be better: with inflation and interest rates at very low levels, and the historic opportunity of the European reconstruction plan, it is the time to reduce unemployment as quickly as possible and to adopt measures to increase potential growth, mitigate the impact of climate change and reduce inequality. It is the moment to be ambitious and think big. @angelubide ",['Ángel Ubide']

2020-09-08, 11:49 UTC,Rethinking the European spirit,opinion,/opinion/2020-09-08/rethinking-the-european-spirit.html,"In The World of Yesterday, Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig remembers the optimism of the years immediately before the First World War when the French aviator Louis Blériot made the first cross-Channel flight: “We rejoiced in Vienna as if he were a hero of our own nation,” he recalls. The “triumphs of technology and science, which succeeded one another by the hour, had led for the first time to a European sense of community, the development of a European identity. How pointless, we said to ourselves, frontiers were if it was child’s play for any aircraft to cross them.” Zweig of course was looking back – not without nostalgia – from the vantage point of 1941, a long time after the illusion of a European culture had been lost on the battlefields of Flanders and Poland, and a year before his suicide, as his ideal of Europe was shattered once again by the march of fascism. After 1945, the European Project set out to rebuild the “European sense of community” that Zweig had seen destroyed, but this time based on democratic values and a recognition of the need for peace in Europe rooted in the memory of two world wars. The idea of a “European spirit” was closely tied in this project to high culture, to the heritage of Leonardo, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Beethoven, the most precious thing to distinguish Europe, as it found its place between the US, with its mass commercial culture, to the west, and the Soviet bloc on Europe’s eastern frontier. There could not be a better symbol of European culture than Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the glorious choral finale of the Ninth Symphony celebrating freedom and the brotherhood of man, which became the official anthem of the European Union. Today those ideals are under threat again. The EU is struggling politically to cope with the combined challenges of climate change, globalization and the migrant crisis, as nationalist forces pull electorates away from the union. In Hungary and Poland these electorates have returned a quasi-fascist form of authoritarian government incompatible with the EU’s principles. If “Europe” is to survive, we must decide what being “European” means. What unites us? Shared values? A shared culture? A shared history? Are we any more than the sum of our parts? Zweig was writing of a European world before the First World War (his “world of security”) when “people no more believed in the possibility of barbaric relapses, such as wars between the nations of Europe, than they believed in ghosts and witches.” That optimism had been based on the peace and progress of the 19th century when Europe was united by a shared culture spread across the continent by railways, cheap mass printing and the economics of the marketplace. By 1900, the same books were being read across Europe, the same paintings reproduced, the same music played at home or heard in concert halls and the same operas performed in all the major theaters of Europe – their tunes made popular in music-halls and cafés and by organ grinders in the street. Before the age of the gramophone, there was no great divide between “high” and “popular” culture. A “European school” in every art was formed on top of national traditions as the cultural traffic and cross-fertilizations between nations fostered richer hybrid forms. “In a book of that era,” wrote French poet Paul Valéry of European culture just before the First World War, “we should have no trouble in finding: the influence of the Russian ballet, a touch of Pascal’s gloom, numerous impressions of the Goncourt type, something of Nietzsche, something of Rimbaud, certain effects due to a familiarity with the Impressionist painters, sometimes the tone of a scientific publication – the whole flavored with an indefinably British quality!” How this “European culture” was created is the subject of my book, The Europeans: Three Lives and the Making of a Cosmopolitan Culture. At the center of its argument are three key inventions of the 19th century that enabled such a culture to develop on a continent-wide and mass level. An international culture had existed in Europe since at least the Renaissance but it was limited to the elites and their narrow networks on the continent. It was only with the railways, cheap mass printing and the spread of international copyright that a pan-European culture spread to every level of society. The railways enabled artists and their works to move around the continent more easily. They opened up new markets for their work and began the modern age of mass foreign travel, enabling Europeans in much greater numbers to recognize their commonalities. It allowed them to discover their own “Europeanness,” the values they shared with other peoples across Europe, above and beyond their separate nationalities. Cheap mass printing, made possible by modern techniques of lithography, allowed artists and their publishers to reach a larger international public. The rise of literacy and the growing middle-class demand for books, sheet music and art prints underpinned the profits to be made from this printing revolution, as large print-runs brought prices down. The spread of international copyright – one of the great but overlooked achievements of the 19th century – enabled artists, writers and composers to make a stable income from the reproduction of their work. It turned the artwork into a form of capital in whose exploitation artists and their publishers could share. It gave publishers an incentive to invest for longer in a work of art, and to set up offices abroad to collect foreign royalties. The Berne Convention of 1886, the founding charter of modern international copyright, underpinned the globalization of artistic production in the 20th century. It was through these market forces that a European canon formed. As the market for cheaper books, art reproductions and sheet music grew, it became more profitable for publishers to focus on mass prints of the most successful, tried-and-tested works. Likewise, in the theater, for example, once the railways could bring in a larger public than had been possible in the days of horse and carriage, larger theaters could be built and longer runs of the most successful works could be produced. In the 18th century the vast majority of operas were performed for one season, and then never repeated. But in the later 19th-century, operas such as Gounod’s Faust or Verdi’s Rigoletto were performed several hundred times, season after season, in the major theaters of Europe. There was of course a nationalist reaction against this European standardization. Critics who assigned the highest virtue to national character wondered if the arts would all end up the same. Such concerns were loudly voiced in France at the turn of the 20th century, when there was a flood of translated novels into the French book market. “We have really been invaded, and from every side at once,” wrote one critic. “If we do not keep our guard, soon there will be no French literature.” Similar reactions could be found across the continent. The opening of countries to international currents was accompanied in most of them by a reactive nationalism in the arts and politics. Political nationalism grew in the final decades of the 19th century. It was different from the nationalism that had evolved before 1848, the year of democratic revolutions across Europe, when the nationalists’ defense of language rights, cultural and political freedoms, was more inclusive than the forms of ethnic nation-building pioneered by later nationalists. The technological forces that enabled Europe’s growing cultural cosmopolitanism could also be employed by nationalists – cheap printing to disseminate a patriotic canon, the railways to move armies to the front, as Bismarck and his generals did to such effect in the Franco-Prussian War. Their example would be followed by the armies of the First World War. “Now that a great storm has long since destroyed it,” Zweig wrote in 1941, “we know at last that our world of security was a castle in the air.” We know even better now. We understand that new technologies, rapid cultural and economic change, are more conducive to disunity than to unity between nations. Globalization works not only to reduce the cultural gap between countries (“everywhere’s the same these days,” as the refrain of weary tourists goes) but to increase national, regional and class-based fears of losing out to these changes (loss of jobs to new technologies and cheaper labor in Asia, loss of markets, and so on) – changes which our governments cannot control. We are all at the mercy of the multinational tech giants. In that much, at least, we are united. What can Europe do to stand its ground in this globalized culture? What remains of our cultural identity as Europeans in this world? Ode to Joy is an inspiring symbol of European unity. It was fittingly employed to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall in a Christmas Day concert in 1989, and its hopeful song, an antidote to nationalism, may well stir our better international emotions (it was loudly heard at French President Emmanuel Macron’s election victory rally after his defeat of Marine Le Pen in 2017). But the high-cultural heritage which that chorus represents is too highbrow and too remote in the past to mean much to the majority of Europe’s citizens, who are more likely to identify with Beyoncé than with Beethoven. The old culture of Europe, its ancient towns and cities, cathedrals, palaces, universities and galleries, attracts tens of millions of tourists every year. They come in part in search of “culture,” a list of cultural monuments to be ticked off a list of things that must be “done” by the “civilized” person. This is culture as an acquisition or commodity, an industry in which Europe’s brand is highly prized. But Europe has to be more than a tourist destination, more than just a marketplace, if it is to survive as a union. It needs a political identity, a point well made by Macron in a recent interview with The Economist. It needs to defend the autonomy of European space to protect the interests of its citizens: to collect taxes from the tech giants and end their tax havens; to regulate their industries to protect labor rights and international copyright; to pass new European laws to stop the undermining of democracies by disinformation on social media sites; to enforce collective EU policies on climate change, the migrant crisis, gender equality, minority rights and so on. These are European principles – they all have their roots in the great ideals of liberty, equality, fraternity – and we need to defend them. What are the lessons we can learn from “the world of yesterday,” from the great advances of European civilization in the 19th century? We the Europeans have lost our confidence, our belief in the values of that civilization. Like its allied concept, the “Enlightenment,” the very term itself, “European civilization,” has become discredited. In the eyes of some it is practically synonymous with “colonialism,” “dead white men”, even “white supremacy.” It has dropped out of public discourse because others fear public shaming, or even loss of jobs if they use it. This political correctness is based on a partial view of history. There were many men and women in the 19th century who championed the ideals of European civilization, not as a form of Europe’s domination of its subject colonies, but as a progressive force of cosmopolitanism and the broadest cultural exchange between “civilizations.” They saw Europe as a hybrid culture, enriched by external influences, like the Mongols in Russia or the Moors in Spain. Both were studied in great depth by Louis Viardot, a republican socialist, journalist, art expert and translator, who stands at the center of my book with his more famous wife, Pauline Viardot, a great singer and composer, and the writer Ivan Turgenev, with whom the Viardots had a long relationship, a ménage à trois. Their example is a timely reminder of the progressive role that can be played by European civilization as an outward-looking and inclusive force. Turgenev and the Viardots were cosmopolitans, capable of living anywhere on European soil, provided it did not offend their democratic principles, without losing any of their nationality. Edmund Burke’s maxim – that “No European can be a complete exile in any part of Europe” – might have been designed for them. Is Burke’s rule still true? I hope so. With our EU passports, we travel more within Europe, and have a greater sense of connection with other European countries, if only through our shared lifestyle of restaurants, cafés, shops, entertainments and pleasures. Growing numbers of us work and live abroad, owning homes, bringing up our children to be European citizens. This “passport Europe” may not be a “home.” There will be many who identify with native soil, familiar food and TV shows rather than an international ID card. But it is a sanctuary in troubled times, and we must protect its European principles. Orlando Figes is a British historian.

2020-09-23, 09:06 UTC,Spanish government pressures Madrid to take tougher action against Covid-19 epidemic,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-23/spanish-government-pressures-madrid-to-take-tougher-action-against-covid-19.html,"Spain’s central government has decided to indirectly take charge of the health crisis in the Madrid region, which is once again the epicenter of the Covid-19 epidemic in the country. Although powers over healthcare are devolved to the regions and Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) has pledged not to declare another national state of alarm like the one that kept Spaniards confined between mid-March and mid-June, the central executive is pressuring Madrid premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso to adopt tougher measures against the spread of the virus. Díaz Ayuso, of the conservative Popular Party (PP), is being asked to leave key decisions on Covid-19 management in the hands of her health chief and other health department experts, with whom the central government is in close contact. On Monday, selective confinements went into effect in 37 health areas located within the Spanish capital and several other towns in the Madrid region with very high rates of infection. Local residents have staged street protests against what they see as unfair targeting of low-income neighborhoods. Although Díaz Ayuso has long resisted the idea of a broader region-wide confinement, Madrid government sources said that she is now more open to stricter measures. Spain’s Health Minister Salvador Illa on Tuesday suggested that the central government wants a bigger role in handling the Madrid health crisis, while avoiding an open confrontation with the regional premier. Speaking on SER radio station, Illa said that all Madrileños, and not just the residents of the confined areas, should stay home save for essential business. Madrid Mayor José Luis Martínez Almeida, of the PP, backed this statement: “I would follow the minister’s advice.” Until now, according to sources from both the central and regional governments, Díaz Ayuso and her close aides had been blocking all attempts at stricter measures to control the spread of the coronavirus in the region, where incidence over the last 14-day period now stands at 746 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, or 2.6 times the Spanish average. The region is also dealing with the highest pressure on its healthcare system, with a quarter of its beds occupied by Covid-19 patients. According to data published on Tuesday by the regional government, 16 additional health areas in the region have a Covid-19 incidence rate above 1,000 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Díaz Ayuso has suggested that restrictions on mobility may need to be extended beyond the current areas. On Monday, Díaz Ayuso met with the Spanish prime minister after publicly asking the central government to get “actively involved” in the fight against the coronavirus. The move marked a change in attitude after the Madrid administration had claimed for months that the national lockdown had not allowed regional authorities to effectively deal in heir own way with the crisis. According to sources in the central executive familiar with the contents of Monday’s meeting, Díaz Ayuso has finally acknowledged that the situation in Madrid is very serious and that she needs to give more power of decision to the regional health chief, Enrique Ruiz Escudero. While other regions of Spain with high coronavirus incidence, like Aragón or Catalonia, quickly introduced partial or local lockdowns on the advice of their own health teams, Madrid has been the exception. In Madrid, there has been a clear disconnect between the health department chief and the regional premier. Last week, Díaz Ayuso also discredited statements by the deputy health chief, Antonio Zapatero, regarding imminent confinements in Madrid – even though the confinements were ultimately approved. These kinds of internal clashes are not new. In May, during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Madrid’s chief of public healthcare, Yolanda Fuentes, walked out on the job after her warnings about Madrid’s lack of preparedness for a potential second wave went unheeded. But now, central and regional sources agree that Díaz Ayuso is ready to give her health officials more leeway. Technical meetings between specialists from both administrations are already underway. Sources in the Madrid executive said that Díaz Ayuso is now resigned to the fact that the current containment measures are insufficient and that stricter ones will need to be introduced. The decision to isolate 37 high-incidence areas was described as “a surgical procedure” meant to save the Madrid economy from a complete confinement, which Díaz Ayuso last week said would be “death for our region.” English version by Susana Urra.

2020-09-23, 06:29 UTC,"‘It is easy to blame us for spread of Covid-19, rather than the people in authority’",society,/society/2020-09-23/it-is-easy-to-blame-us-for-spread-of-covid-19-rather-than-the-people-in-authority.html,"Francisco Albarrán was 21 years old when he left Ávila province and came to the Madrid district of Usera looking for work. It was 1974 and he found a job in a bar that had been open for six months called Vicentín. He went on to run the place and has been behind the bar now for a total of 46 years. Dressed in a maroon shirt and black apron, Albarrán serves coffee to a customer playing the slot machines. “I’m thinking of retiring for the first time. Not because I want to, but because this is forcing me to,” he says. By “this,” he is referring to the virus. Half a year after it first emerged, Covid-19 no longer needs to be referred to by name. “This country has been through a lot since 1974,” he adds. “Dictatorship, crises... But this is the worst.” In a bid to curb coronavirus contagion in the region, the Madrid government has placed 37 basic health areas – many of them in working-class – under a selective lockdown. Usera is one of the districts affected by the new rules, which came into effect on Monday. Under these rules, people in the affected areas are only allowed in and out for essential activities such as going to school or work, or to care for dependents. Public parks in the restricted zone have been closed, capacity at stores and other commercial establishments reduced to 50% and closing time set at 10pm, with the exception of pharmacies and gas stations. As of Monday, Albarrán’s bar is only allowed 10 customers inside at once, none of whom can stand at the counter; and it has to close by 10pm. But he was closing at that time even before the new restrictions came into effect. “Things don’t work like they used to, whether that’s 20 customers inside or opening beyond 10pm,” he says. It’s 10am and the Vicentín has been open since 7am. “People act irresponsibly and recommendations are not followed. Twenty guys meet and nothing happens,” says Albarrán, adding, “I am 67 and I have never regretted coming here from Ávila; Madrid has given me everything.” The Vicentín is in Rafaela Ybarra street in the Zofío area of the Usera district where restrictions were enforced due to the high coronavirus transmission rates. The street is named after an affluent 19th century woman from Bilbao who gave alms to the poor using silk gloves to avoid dirtying her hands. “She realized that this was not right,” wrote Carmen Torres in a biography Rafaela Ybarra. The Lover of God. Exchanging her luxurious clothes for humble attire, Ybarra dedicated her life to caring for girls and young women, for which she was beatified. When her husband, the president of the manufacturing company, Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, inquired after her fortune, he was told that his wife kept it in the best bank there was – heaven. Today if Ybarra was to grace the street named after her, she would have to pull her gloves back on. In the parish of San Juan de Avila, in Fornillos street, there is a quote from her, placed there in 2003, which reads: “Gaze on this world, as it was all made through love for you, and all it is, and all things in it, speak of love, and demand love, and mean love.” When entering the church itself, a sign informs visitors that there is no holy water and that the sign of peace is made without touching. “It is easy to blame us for the uncontrolled spread [of the virus], rather than the people in authority or those who should have given us the resources to organize ourselves,” says Montse, a young unemployed woman who is taking her dog out at 11am. “What are they going to do about the people who have to work outside the area – which is the majority?” she asks. “What are they going to do about the people waiting for a PCR test? And what are they going to do about people with children? Why are some of us affected and others aren’t? Because of the way we behave? So how are they behaving in the center of the city?” On Marina Usera street, a man drops his cigarette which falls close to the feet of Juan Carlos Valdeoliva, who is standing at the door of the Luarca bar. Valdeoliva works at the bar and lives in the Usera district. “The measures are a joke and, because of them, many businesses here are definitely going to go down the drain,” he says. So why is the spread of the disease so virulent in the district? “Because there are a lot of assholes who don’t do what they should,” he replies, then, reiterating the prejudices that have taken root in various sectors of the population, he adds, “I’m not a racist, but South Americans don’t give a damn about the measures.” During the Spanish Civil War, Zofío – a health area in the Usera district – was known as the Usera front where one of the most important episodes of the Republican defense of Madrid took place. The sculptor Emilio Barral died nearby, hit by a shell, and had the following lines dedicated to him by Spanish poet, Antonio Machado: “Emiliano Barral, captain of the Segovia militia, fell at the gates of Madrid, defending his country against an army of traitors, mercenaries and foreigners.” Julio Embid calls the Madrid district of Carabanchel home, though he currently lives in Zaragoza province, where he works as a coordinator for the Socialist Party’s (PSOE) parliamentary group in Aragón. Carabanchal, like Usera, is also under a selective lockdown. In 2016, Embid wrote an essay called Concrete Children; How do we live on the southern fringes of Madrid? In it, he talks about how five-story syndicate blocks were built between the M-30 and M-40 ring roads, housing thousands of people during the 1960s from all over Spain, their diversity of origin reflected in the street names. “Many of the streets in the Pilar neighborhood are called after Galician towns, and in El Pozo, the names are towns in Córdoba; in Aluche it’s towns in Toledo,” he tells EL PAÍS by phone. Embid sheds light on what he terms “one of the most unequal cities in Europe,” explaining that there is a four-year difference in life expectancy between El Viso, the capital’s wealthiest neighborhood, and Villaverde, in the far south. “There are just three hospitals for a million inhabitants: Gómez Ulla, 12 de Octubre and Infanta Leonor. Nowhere else in Spain with a million inhabitants do they have just three hospitals,"" he says, referring to Madrid’s southern districts. ""If you live in Las Águilas, in the south of Madrid, and you work in La Moraleja, for every 19 years, you will spend an entire one on a train,” he adds. “The distances are long and public transportation has not improved. Not only has it not improved, between 2005 to 2014, the inflation rate in Madrid rose by 10 points while the basic monthly transport pass rose by 45 points.” Emid also points out another difference in this area: the rise of the misery economy. Since the financial crisis, there has been a notable increase in “businesses that can only work if people are doing badly, such as betting stores, pawnshops and witchcraft stores – for the desperate,” he says. Meanwhile, in the neighboring Carabanchel district, five communions take place at 12:30pm in Colonia de la Prensa. Many journalists would retire to villas in this old residential district at the start of the 20th century. Several of these villas are still standing, but many were demolished when the area began to attract more working-class families. A group of people in formal dress stand out in the empty street. Antonio Palacios, a psychologist, emerges from one of the communions. “It is unfair to take issue just with the individual responsibility of the locals,” he says. “The authorities don’t follow the advice of the experts – such as providing trackers, more primary healthcare resources, planning for schools and teachers. There is a very clear lack of responsibility.” The communion was supposed to be held in May but had to be put off until last weekend. It almost didn’t happen. “I don’t know if it could be held after Monday,” says Palacios, in reference to the new restrictions which have reduced capacity at religious sites to one third. “Today, 10 relatives, including parents, can enter the church. There is no lunch, and although we had planned to go to a park to celebrate, with the weather as it is, we can’t do that either.” The weather is cloudy with showers in Carabanchel. People come and go from the local market. There is a queue at the fishmonger and butcher with people standing more than a meter and a half apart, occupying almost the entire market. Tucked away, cobbler Mariano is at his stall making shoes. He knows that things have changed but as he lives in another district, he doesn’t think he will have any problems. “If there are any problems, they’ll give me a pass or something,” he says. “At this stage, they need to let me get on.” English version by Heather Galloway.

2020-09-22, 14:52 UTC,Spanish Health Ministry finalizing agreement with regions to reduce coronavirus quarantine from 14 to 10 days,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-22/spanish-health-ministry-finalizing-agreement-with-regions-to-reduce-coronavirus-quarantine-from-14-to-10-days.html,"The Spanish Health Ministry is finalizing a deal with regional governments to reduce quarantine times from 14 days to 10 for close contacts of people who tested positive for Covid-19. Health Minister Salvador Illa on Tuesday confirmed that central and regional authorities are discussing the measure and said that “there is a broad consensus, though not a unanimous agreement.” The proposal could be adopted sometime on Tuesday, the minister added. Earlier on Tuesday, the Catalan government announced a reduced quarantine period for close contacts beginning next week. According to the Health Ministry’s existing protocol, a person who tests positive for Covid-19 may reduce his or her isolation period to 10 days if more than 72 hours have elapsed without any fever or symptoms. Meanwhile, close contacts must quarantine for 14 days, although a shorter period is also contemplated if a PCR test is done on the 10th day and it comes back negative. Under the new plan, close contacts of a positive case would be able to end their quarantine period after 10 days without the need for a PCR test. The scientific community came up with the 14-day isolation period at the beginning of the pandemic because that is the maximum incubation period for the coronavirus. But new evidence has emerged in recent months suggesting that after the 10th day, the chances of contagion are substantially reduced. To this must be added the social and economic difficulties of quarantining contacts, all of which has led government officials to consider shorter periods that would be easier to comply with. On September 7, the head of Spain’s Coordination Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies, Fernando Simón, explained that Spain was considering the option of reducing quarantine times to 10 days. Catalonia has already taken the first step and announced 10-day quarantines starting next week. “If we can ensure that quarantines become more compact and better, they will be increasingly observed,” said Josep Maria Argimon, the Catalan secretary for public health, in recent statements. On Tuesday, Argimon insisted that it is important to isolate properly in order to keep the pandemic in check. “Isolation and quarantine need to be improved,” he said. “We have repeatedly told the Spanish government that a person who needs to care for children forced to stay home should receive some kind of aid in order to properly observe the isolation period.” Spain is not the first country to consider reducing quarantine times to make them easier to observe. A couple of weeks ago, France announced it would halve quarantine periods from 14 to seven days for people with symptoms of Covid-19, those whose PCR tests come back negative, and those in close contact with positive cases. A committee of experts advising the French government said that in some parts of the country the quarantines were being unevenly observed, and that available scientific evidence shows that the likelihood of contagion beyond the eighth day is very low. The Netherlands have also reduced quarantine times to 10 days. English version by Susana Urra. ",['Jessica Mouzo']

According to data published on Tuesday by the regional government, 16 health areas in the region have a Covid-19 incidence rate above 1,000 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Despite this, these hotspots are not subject to the new restrictions on mobility that came into effect in 37 basic health areas on Monday. A basic health area is much smaller than a city district and can include several primary healthcare centers. There are around 286 basic health areas in the Madrid region, according to the regional health department. The 16 health areas with an incidence rate above 1,000 cases but that are not under the new restrictions are: Lavapiés, Canillejas, García Noblejas, San Isidro, Rafael Alberti, Orcasitas, Vicálvaro-Artilleros, Campo de la Paloma, Villaamil (all located in the city of Madrid); Doctor Trueta and Miguel Servet (both in Alcorcón); Las Fronteras (Torrejón de Ardoz); Panaderas (Fuenlabrada); Villa del Prado (in the municipality of the same name); Alcalde Bartolomé González (Móstoles); and Sierra de Guadarrama (Collado Villalba). Although the incidence rate of Covid-19 was not the only data point used to decide which areas should be placed under selective lockdown, it was an important factor. Under the new restrictions on mobility, people in the affected areas are only allowed in and out for essential activities such as going to school or work, or to care for dependents. Public parks in the restricted zone have been closed, capacity at stores and other commercial establishments reduced to 50% and closing time set at 10pm, with the exception of pharmacies and gas stations. In a radio interview with Onda Cero on Tuesday morning, Madrid premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso acknowledged that the restrictions may need to be extended to new areas and even to the entire region. “I’m clear that [the measures] will have to be brought to more areas of Madrid and also other sectors,” she said. Speaking on Monday after a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on how to control the situation, the Madrid premier also said: “If we see that the measures are working and we see that there is a worrying trend in other areas, we will apply them as well.” Díaz Ayuso, however, ruled out making a decision on extending restrictions on Tuesday – a point Madrid’s regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero appeared to contradict. “Normally we release the weekly [epidemiological] report on Tuesday, meaning that over the course of today we will be assessing if one area needs to be extended or if another type of decision needs to be made,” he said in the interview with Onda Cero. It was yet another example of the tense relationship between health experts and politicians in the regional government. While the former have called for more drastic measures to control the spread of the coronavirus, the latter have opted for more surgical and less-extensive restrictions in the hopes of curbing contagion while protecting the economy. Meanwhile, Health Minister Salvador Illa recommended on Tuesday that all residents in Madrid stay at home in a bid to curb contagion in the region, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic in Europe. “We would recommend Madrileños restrict their movement as much as possible in the coming days, that they scrupulously respect measures from the regional health authority, restrict non-essential travel and limit contact to the closest cohabitants,” Illa said in a radio interview with Cadena SER. Minutes later, the mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, backed the health minister’s suggestions in a separate interview with the same radio network. “I would recommend the same as Minister Illa,” he said. “At this point in time, limit all mobility that is not essential.” English version by Melissa Kitson.

2020-09-22, 07:07 UTC,"‘A third of Spaniards would get vaccinated tomorrow, but another third have serious reservations’",society,/society/2020-09-22/a-third-of-spaniards-would-get-vaccinated-tomorrow-but-another-third-have-serious-reservations.html,"Covid-19 vaccines will not solve anything by themselves. The thing that will end the pandemic is getting people to take them when they become available. This nuance has been the focus of a recent study carried out by the sociologist Josep Lobera for the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology (Fecyt), which reports to the Science Ministry, exploring people’s perceptions regarding the Covid-19 vaccine. Indeed, there is a very real concern shared by governments around the world that many people might refuse to be vaccinated, putting the possibility of herd immunity at risk. According to Lobera’s research, based on 2,100 surveys, only one-third of Spaniards would be prepared to get vaccinated tomorrow. Another third are wary of a rushed vaccine and afraid of playing guinea pig for a product that may not be entirely safe yet. But while this “swing” group could be persuaded, there is another demographic, amounting to almost a third of the population, who have deep-seated reservations. This group includes around two-and-a-half million people whose ideas mirror the “alternative” views of the Spanish singer and actor Miguel Bosé. In several social media messages, the Spanish actor and singer Miguel Bosé claims, without offering any proof, that an international elite has artificially created the coronavirus in order to have an excuse to vaccinate the world’s entire population and implant everyone with “microchips or nanobots with the sole purpose of controlling them.” Bosé also warns that once the 5G mobile networking standard has been rolled out, which is “a key in this operation for world domination, we will be sheep at their mercy.” Bosé has 2.5 million followers on Twitter and 3.1 million on Facebook. But in early September he announced that he was quitting social media because ""they do not allow freedom of expression and subject users to their own corporate and political criteria and interests,"" according to a statement released by his lawyers. A profound distrust of the authorities has developed over the years due to the financial crises and social-media-sourced information, meaning that this third demographic is not open to persuasion where the vaccine is concerned, and furthermore shows signs of becoming increasingly reluctant to be part of a normally functioning society. It is this latter aspect that concerns Lobera the most. It is not only about mistrust in the management of a given government; this demographic is increasingly embracing conspiracy theories and rejecting the most basic elements needed for social cohesion. “We are at a stage when society could become far more fragmented than it has been and, given the indicators, it seems to me that Spain is among those Western societies at greatest risk of splintering right now,” says Lobera, who explains the conclusions drawn from his research. Question. There is a very clear difference between what the Spanish people think of vaccines in general and the Covid-19 vaccine in particular. Answer. There are far more reservations. In Spain, the level of acceptance regarding vaccines in general has been different from the rest of Europe. In general, attitudes are very favorable here; people think they are safe. But in this particular case, the ground is less fertile. People are more wary, which is in line with other countries. We have a third of respondents who would be prepared to be vaccinated tomorrow, another third that has reservations but could be persuaded, and then a little less than a third that has a great many reservations. And within that group, 7% are totally against. That’s 2.5 million people who are very much against any coronavirus vaccine. We have a society that is pretty fragmented in its attitudes, which is quite different from the scenario regarding childhood vaccines, on which there was an overwhelmingly positive consensus among the vast majority. Here, there are more gray areas, and that is where the battle is going to be fought. Whoever manages to convince that “swing” group could decide whether we reach the necessary levels of vaccination or not. Q. The reservations are not necessarily the result of absurd conspiracies; in some cases there are more logical misgivings, such as the implications of going for the first vaccine on the market, or the fear that security has been less stringent due to the sense of urgency. A. This is not a homogeneous group and we need to convince those who are ambivalent. The views that are sometimes conveyed in scientific communications, ridiculing this entire group with the suggestion that those distrusting the vaccine are all nuts... That is not helpful when it comes to winning over this grey zone. Because it is a very large group and mostly open to persuasion. But they have an argument and reasonable doubts. There is a great range of positions, but there are a lot of people who don’t want the first vaccine that comes out, nor the second – what they’re saying is “Don’t play guinea pig with me. I already know how science works; it takes many years to develop a vaccine and suddenly you pull one out of the hat?” Q. They are not against getting vaccinated per se, but are concerned about being part of the trial stage. A. It ties in with an emerging ambivalence towards science since the 1980s. There is a section of the population that understands risk and uncertainty to be a key aspect of scientific progress, and they don’t want to be affected by possible unintended negative consequences. This mistrust is also very varied. There are those who distrust the pharmaceutical companies and others who distrust the link-up between science and politics. Q. Your research found that suspicion also arises with regard to the interests of those financing the research in other areas of science and technology. A. There is a very large group whose distrust is linked to economic issues. The big pharmaceutical companies, financial interests, even geopolitical interests. For others, suspicion arises because science generates risks and scientists are not Superman – it’s okay for them to experiment, but not with my family, thank you. Q. There are four groups that are particularly reluctant to be vaccinated against Covid-19: people with higher education, people on high incomes, people in good health, and the self-employed. Skepticism among the first three groups is common, but where does the reluctance of the self-employed stem from? A. This is new and it has surprised me because statistically, it is very significant. It wasn’t the case with childhood vaccinations, and I can only explain it as a boomerang effect of motivated argument: the self-employed have suffered from higher levels of anxiety and greater uncertainty due to their personal circumstances, whether the impact is on their business, their way of life or their work in recent years. And given these circumstances, my theory is that these people are more likely to say things like, “They’re exaggerating; they’re doing it wrong; it’s just that they don’t know; the politicians don’t have a clue; they say one thing one day and then another; look at this doctor on YouTube.” These people have more reason to challenge the scientific consensus and the health authorities on confinement, vaccination, and so on. Q. They are mistrustful. A. I feel that it’s something that goes beyond vaccines and is a broader argument regarding how the pandemic is being managed. And that is something that worries me. We are at a stage when society could become far more fractured than it has been and, given the indicators, it seems to me that Spain is among the Western societies at greatest risk of splintering right now. It’s not about being left-wing or right-wing; it’s more about whether the risks affect you far more than they affect others, and the fear and mistrust that comes from that that can run very deep. Q. How does this social splintering manifest itself? A. Without social cohesion we can’t function – not without a minimum of trust in the government, the police, the teachers and the healthcare workers. Up to now, the levels of trust have been very low – a lack of confidence coupled with extreme political polarization: right-wing people are very suspicious of the decisions made by left-wing politicians and vice versa. But with the coronavirus, I think this distrust could reach much deeper and more dangerous levels. Not only is there mistrust in the government, but conspiracy theories are also coming into play, and this leads to more dysfunctional levels –to an absence of the kind of trust that is essential for coexistence and social functioning. Q. What do you make of the denial movements? Are they merely anecdotal? A. No, they’re not at all anecdotal. They represent the tip of the iceberg, the visible expression of that whole process of mistrust that is growing in various social groups. There have been relatively low and decreasing levels of trust over the last decades, with the crisis and austerity and so on. But this [Covid-19] has had a huge impact, causing certain groups to break away from very basic areas of agreement. And it is concerning, because this is not going to be the end of it; it looks like it is going to turn into a marathon – the vaccine will arrive and it will not be 100% effective. You then have a false hope scenario that could fuel further mistrust and certain groups may become discouraged. That is to say, the mistrust could then reach a dysfunctional level causing rupture and alternative groups to be formed. And by the time we try to reconnect, a coherent logic may already have been generated within those groups – a vision so different that it could lead to social problems. Q. There are examples of celebrities like Miguel Bosé, the famous singer and conspiracy theorist, in many countries. Is it a sign of what is brewing beneath the surface? A. On the one hand, he is the canary in the coal mine, a warning that something is brewing that we can’t see because we don’t belong to those groups. Millions of people in Spain are very skeptical and hold very alternative views. It’s also an indicator of the influence of political or popular leaders: people will change their perception of vaccines if they receive information from someone they trust on a political, social or cultural level. Q. But Bosé is not a leader when it comes to influencing opinion; a politician would surely be considered more dangerous. A. Yes, but if I start to distrust the official version, I will select opinions that interest me from certain influencers. Suddenly, I will put more trust in what Miguel Bosé says. However, the majority of the “anti” demographic are found in the realms of political polarization. it is clear that people further to the right from the Popular Party and Vox, and further to the left who belong to fringe parties – not so much in Podemos – have a greater degree of mistrust in the vaccine. In [the anti-mask demonstration in] Plaza de Colón [in downtown Madrid], all of these elements were present. That’s why political leaders from all parties need to be included in the protocols and decisions. If we begin to exclude the political leaders we have less affinity with, we may find we are exacerbating the extremes. For example, if a Vox leader is on the vaccine commission and starts boasting that “thanks to us, we will have safe vaccines,” you will considerably reduce the mistrust within one of the groups most likely to feel it. This is strategic and important. Q. What do you think the vaccination process will look like? A. I think there will be a moment when things become fragmented. I think there are going to be people who will directly oppose it. I think those increasing levels of mistrust can lead to levels of confrontation such as those we’ve already seen between two people fighting over mask-wearing because they see the other person as a danger to their health, freedom, and rights. But I strongly believe that we are going to see a bigger fragmentation and that there will be groups that are angry at other groups for getting vaccinated or not. And then there will be the group in between that will fluctuate. And depending on how we manage communication, that “swing” group, which will be key to herd immunity, could go either way. Q. But getting communication right is very complex on many levels. There is no silver bullet. A. There is no silver bullet, but there are things that come with a high price tag. We need more measures to restore trust. If we rely on science-based communication that makes fun of people who are suspicious of the vaccine, that’s going to come at a cost. If the management of the pandemic is perceived as a political war in which the vaccine plays an instrumental role, that’s going to have a cost as well. We are not doing anything to nurture people’s trust; instead, we are eating away at it with poor decision-making. Trust is the fuel for [solving] this crisis, which is going to be drawn out. It is a basic resource which we are squandering, and we are not going to have any left when we need it most. English version by Heather Galloway. ",['Javier Salas']
2020-09-21, 08:21 UTC,Police will not issue fines in the first 48 hours of Madrid’s new confinement measures,society,/society/2020-09-21/police-will-not-issue-fines-in-the-first-48-hours-of-madrids-new-confinement-measures.html,"The new restrictions that came into place today in 37 areas of Madrid, in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus, present “huge technical difficulties” in terms of their enforcement, the central government’s delegate in the region, José Manuel Franco, admitted on Sunday. More than 850,000 Madrileños from eight different municipalities from today are subject to measures limiting mobility, and that are not far from the strict lockdown that was implemented in March across the country by the central administration. For the first 48 hours of the new restrictions, however, the police will not be issuing fines for non-compliance but will rather be informing citizens of the new situation, regional justice chief Enrique López explained on Sunday. Local police officers, supported by the National Police and the Civil Guard, will be responsible for ensuring that residents of the affected areas respect the rules. People will be able to access a form on the internet that they can fill out to justify their exit from and entrance to the confined zones. From Monday, across the region, meetings of more than six people are no longer permitted apart from in a work or institutional environment. In the 37 healthcare areas subject to stricter restrictions, capacity in businesses, academies, sports centers, cinemas, theaters, libraries and hostelry is limited to 50% while closing time will be at 10pm. Home delivery is permitted after that time. Parks and gardens in the affected areas have also been closed. In the city of Madrid, the affected health areas are located in the city districts of Carabanchel (the health areas of Puerta Bonita, Vista Alegre and Guayaba), Usera (Almendrales, Las Calesas, Zofío, Orcasur and San Fermín), Villaverde (San Andrés, San Cristóbal, El Espinillo and Los Rosales), Villa de Vallecas, Puente de Vallecas (Entrevías, Martínez de la Riva, San Diego, Numancia, Peña Prieta, Pozo del Tío Raimundo, Ángela Uriarte, Alcalá de Guadaira and Federica Montseny), and Ciudad Lineal (Doctor Cirajas, Ghandi, Daroca and La Elipa). The affected municipalities besides the capital are Fuenlabrada (the health areas of Alicante, Cuzco and Francia), Parla (San Blas and Isabel II), San Sebastián de los Reyes (Reyes Católicos), Getafe (Las Margaritas and Sánchez Morate), Alcobendas (Chopera and Miraflores) and the entire towns of Humanes and Moraleja de Enmedio. A meeting was held on Sunday at the Madrid 112 Security and Emergencies Agency to finalize the way in which the measures would be applied. The conference took place while demonstrations were being held in various parts of the region in protest at the measures, which were described by attendees as “inefficient and discriminatory.” A total of 200 municipal officers will be monitoring the Spanish capital, setting up more than 60 checkpoints that will be rotated over the next two weeks in the 26 basic healthcare areas that are subject to the new restrictions. The government of Madrid reiterated on Sunday that, in its view, the region is not in an “extraordinary” situation that would require the implementation of a localized state of alarm, an option that the prime minister of the national government, Pedro Sánchez, has made available to Spain’s regions, which have been in charge of managing the pandemic since the deescalation of the emergency situation across the country came to an end in July. “There would have to be extraordinary circumstances that were impeding maintaining normality,” argued Enrique López on Sunday. “At the current time the normal exercising of public powers is sufficient to deal with these extraordinary circumstances,” he continued, adding that the measures that have been introduced today are aimed at avoiding a state of alarm in the region. Asked about whether even stricter measures may be introduced, such as a lockdown of the entire region, Madrid health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero sought to convey a message of calm, saying that if the restrictions are complied with there would be no need to take further steps. Escudero admitted that the primary healthcare system, an essential factor in stopping the spread of the virus, was not up to the task and that there are problems hiring more doctors and nurses. For now, the medicalized hotels that were set up during the first wave of the coronavirus earlier this year will be reopened, but this time to assist citizens who need to comply with quarantine periods, Escudero explained. He added that the network of contact tracers is aware of 1,468 people who have skipped their isolation period. There are 180 beds currently available in Madrid’s Hotel Colón, an establishment that was used as a medicalized hotel during the worst days of the pandemic. The regional government has another three hotels at its disposition, Escudero explained. The president of the Federation of Madrid Municipalities and the mayor of Arganda del Rey, Guillermo Hita, who was present at Sunday’s meeting, admitted that the measures are “difficult to enforce,” and insisted on the need for “public awareness.” The regional government will also carry out 850,000 rapid coronavirus tests in order to survey the progress of the virus in the affected areas and to decide whether the restrictions should remain in place for longer than the initial two weeks and whether they should be rolled out in other places.

The announcement was made on Monday by the premier in Catalonia, Quim Torra, who also argued in favor of temperature checks for travelers arriving from Madrid in the northeastern region by train or by plane. Torra, a hardline separatist who is in favor of an independent Catalonia, added that if it is necessary to travel to the Spanish capital, that it should be done “with all of the necessary measures.” Sources from the premier’s office said that the Catalan territorial policy department has already got in touch with ADIF and AENA, the state management companies for rail and air travel, respectively, in order to plan how such checks will be carried out. During an appearance on Monday with the Red Cross aimed at making young people aware of the dangers of the coronavirus, Torra stated that he was putting all of his teams of experts at the disposal of his opposite number in Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso of the conservative Popular Party (PP). Torra also called on Ayuso to take “stricter measures” to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including “not letting anyone leave nor travel to Madrid if there is no certainty that they are negative” for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to the latest figures released by the central Health Ministry on Friday, the Madrid region currently has a cumulative incidence of the coronavirus of 682.57 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks. In Catalonia, meanwhile, the same figure is currently 160.18. English version by Simon Hunter. ",['Blanca Cia']
2020-09-14, 09:14 UTC,Catalonia Day celebrations highlight divisions between separatist parties,politics,/politics/catalonia_independence/2020-09-14/catalonia-day-celebrations-highlight-divisions-between-separatist-parties.html,"Coronavirus measures and political division were both on display on Friday at an unusually low-key Catalonia Day, held every September 11 to mark the anniversary of the fall of Barcelona in 1714 during the War of Spanish Succession. Known locally as “la Diada,” the celebration has recently become a show of support for independence from Spain, with supporters turning out by the hundreds of thousands. But this year featured small-scale events instead of the mass demonstrations organized in previous years by the pro-independence civil associations Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Òmnium. Organizers had asked supporters to observe social distancing to adapt to Covid-19 regulations in force throughout the region. According to the ANC, around 59,500 people attended 131 events across Catalonia. The coronavirus pandemic has played a major role in diminishing the crowds. Spain is in the middle of a second Covid-19 wave and the Barcelona Medical Association had asked for Diada events to be cancelled for safety reasons. The Catalan government this weekend announced a two-week extension of special measures to help contain transmission, including a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. But to judge from the rhetoric of the leaders of both ANC and Òmnium, the political division displayed by the region’s separatist parties did not help draw supporters out in the street, either. The Diada’s main event, organized jointly by both civil associations, sent the politicians of Together for Catalonia (JxCat) and Catalan Republican Left (ERC) a clear message: “Sit and talk. We are tired of tactics.” The statement, delivered by ANC president Elisenda Paluzie, played on a slogan often used by the Catalan independence movement to ask the Madrid government for dialogue. “No more battles or sterile debates. Don’t let yourselves get carried away by partisan interests; think about the entire country,” urged Òmnium leader Marcel Mauri, the latter a reference to the Catalonia region rather than Spain. Both leaders also asked secessionist politicians for a timeline for achieving independence. “People’s patience is not going to last forever,” warned Paluzie. However, no politicians showed up for the ANC event in Barcelona. Only ANC members who had previously registered online occupied the 137 chairs distributed along the four lanes of Aragón street to meet public safety regulations. The ERC’s national coordinator, Pere Aragonès, said on Saturday that he understood where the criticism was coming from, and admitted that his party and JxCat, which are partners in Catalonia’s coalition government, should be on the same page on pressing issues. One of these issues is the possibility that the Supreme Court could remove regional premier Quim Torra from office for violating electoral legislation when he refused to take down a politically charged banner from a public building in March 2019, during the campaign leading up to the municipal and European elections of May 26. Meanwhile ERC and the opposition want Torra to call a regional election as soon as possible, while JxCat seems not to favor this option. Aragonès, who is also the deputy premier of Catalonia, said that both coalition partners should negotiate a joint position on this matter. “We could not forgive ourselves, and neither could citizens, if the independence movement handled an aggression of this magnitude from a position of mutual reproach,” he said about the court challenge. But on Friday, the only image of political unity was provided by the traditional offering of flowers at the foot of the statue of Rafael Casanova, a hero of the 1714 Siege of Barcelona.

2020-09-24, 06:30 UTC,Waiting for tourists in southern Spain’s ghost coast,economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-24/waiting-for-tourists-in-southern-spains-ghost-coast.html,"Sheets cover the lobby furniture and a deadly silence pervades the empty restaurant of the Hotel Amaragua. Outside, someone is removing the leaves that have fallen into the enormous swimming pool that is bereft of bathers, while the usual sun loungers have been stacked. The deserted facilities at the hotel, which is one of the biggest in Torremolinos, a popular resort in Spain’s Málaga province, bring to mind scenes from a horror movie. But this is not fiction; it’s a reality in which around 80% of the Costa del Sol’s hotels have closed their doors, without knowing when they might reopen. “It’s horrific!” says Miguel Sánchez, founder of the MS hotel chain that owns the Amaragua. In 2019, they had 603 guests here at this time of the year. Today, as they close for the first time in 25 years, they have none. Like so many others, it has become a ghost hotel. The scenario is the opposite of the bumper year that had been expected on the Costa del Sol. According to Málaga provincial authorities, in 2019 the hotel industry had a combined direct and indirect turnover of €14.4 billion and generated 180,000 jobs. Over the last 10 years, each year has been better than the last, but 2020 has dramatically reversed the trajectory. “This summer has been disastrous, horrible, enough to make you cry,” says Álvaro Reyes, commercial director of the Alay, a flagship hotel in Benalmádena, which was able to open partially during August. First there was the devastating impact of the three-month coronavirus lockdown, and then the worst summer season in living memory. The average occupancy rates for the establishments that did open were around 35% in July and 40% in August. Most have now closed. The beaches along the Costa del Sol are now deserted. By mid-September, beach-bar barbecues were off the agenda, lifeguards were hanging around their huts and the promenades looked as though they had gone back into lockdown. “It doesn’t even look this empty in winter,” says Reyes. Today, the collapse of the travel giant Thomas Cook and even Brexit seem like minor hiccups compared to the quarantine restrictions and the advisories issued by the British – then the Germans, Belgians and Dutch – to avoid any travel to Spain. “Not many people live here permanently and, without the tourists, there’s hardly anyone around anymore,” says Juan Rueda, who for the last 33 years has run a supermarket next to the Amaragua Hotel. The health crisis forced him to dismiss his only employee, who has found agricultural work in France. “It’s a knock-on effect and now we’ve all felt it,” he says, preparing a sandwich for one of his few customers. The knock-on effect means that, besides hotels, the entire tourist ecosystem, including beach bars, ice cream parlors, car rentals and souvenir shops, is teetering on the edge of disaster. The Málaga province hospitality association, for example, estimates that there will be around 5,000 layoffs over the next few months around Málaga. “The tourist sector on the Costa del Sol is very dependent on international tourism, and it’s paying the price for that,” explains a source from the association, who says that the situation is being exacerbated by the fact that domestic trips organized by the Spanish authorities for the elderly have also been cancelled. Meanwhile, in nearby Cádiz province, which has around 2,600 hotel beds, average occupancy for July and August stood at 60% due to the region’s popularity with national tourists. “The data is acceptable given the current situation,” says Stefan De Clerck, director of Hace Hoteles and president of the Cádiz Hotels Provincial Association. “Though if we were to compare it with 2019, it is, of course, a disaster. Cádiz and Huelva are the coastal regions that have done best in Andalusia this summer.” Despite these figures, the next few weeks are not looking good. “Predicted occupancy for the entire month of September is 20% to 25% compared to 90% in other years. The situation is frankly bad,” adds De Clerck, who has temporarily closed his Duque de Nájera Hotel for the first time since it opened in 1996. “It has been very hard for us.” Now, De Clerck and his staff, like thousands of others, are looking forward to the spring of 2021 with hopes of a more normal season. Of course, that will depend on how the health crisis evolves. “At least we know that people want to come,” says Reyes from the Alay Hotel, which receives many calls from Scandinavian customers assuring them that they will be back. “We’ll be here waiting for them!” English version by Heather Galloway.

2020-09-23, 10:44 UTC,Spanish economy shrank 17.8% in the second quarter due to coronavirus crisis,economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-23/spanish-economy-shrank-178-in-the-second-quarter-due-to-impact-covid-19-pandemic.html,"The Spanish economy entered a technical recession in the second quarter of 2020 after recording a 17.8% fall in gross domestic product (GDP) between April and June. This is the largest quarterly drop since 1970, when the National Statistics Institute (INE) began the historical series. Nothing similar can be found on record since the days of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The decline, however, was slightly under what the INE had forecast in late July when, lacking complete data, it estimated that GDP would fall 18.5% in the second quarter. The year-on-year drop in GDP is now established at 21.5%, compared to the July forecast of 22.1%. Until now, the greatest annual slump in economic output had been recorded in the second quarter of 2009, in the middle of the financial crisis, when year-on-year growth fell by 4.4%. The April-to-June period almost perfectly overlaps with the state of alarm that was declared in Spain to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The country was kept in a strict lockdown and many economic activities slowed down or ground to a complete halt, most notably in the tourism industry. Spain continues to be one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis, even as neighboring nations begin to review their GDP figures upwards. In Europe, only the United Kingdom has posted similar numbers, with a 21.7% drop in output, according to the most recent Eurostat data. Other countries are posting somewhat less dramatic losses: Germany’s output shrank by 11.3%; France’s by 18.9%; Italy’s by 17.7%; Portugal’s by 16.3%; Greece’s by 15.5%; the Netherlands' by 9%; Austria’s by 12.9%; Denmark’s by 8.2%; Sweden’s by 7.7%; Ireland’s by 3.7% and Poland’s by 7.9%. Two factors are being largely blamed for the Spanish figures: first, a stricter lockdown than in other countries, as evidenced by Google and Apple’s mobility data. And second, an economy that is more heavily dependent on the sectors that were hardest hit by the restrictions, chiefly hospitality, transportation, entertainment, and in general all activities requiring social interaction. In terms of the importance of its tourism industry to the economy, only Greece can compare to Spain. And a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has shown that Spain is the country with the highest rate of jobs that are exposed to contagion.

2020-09-22, 09:48 UTC,Spain’s new decree on working from home – everything we know so far,economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-22/spains-new-decree-on-working-from-home-everything-we-know-so-far.html,"The Spanish government, unions and business associations reached a preliminary agreement on Monday on a new decree that regulates remote working, which until a few months ago was an uncommon practice in Spain. That situation changed with the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March, with teleworking prioritized in a bid to reduce contagion. In response to this shift, the government, unions and business associations have been looking for a legal framework to manage the change in work practices. Now, after months of negotiations, new regulations on the rights of remote workers are expected to be approved this Tuesday by Spain’s lower house of parliament, the Congress of Deputies. Although the final details are not yet known – the preliminary agreement still needs to be ratified by unions and industry chiefs – the last draft of the text outlined under what circumstances the new law will be applied, who will cover expenses and how work schedules will be organized. Here are the main points covered by the new regulations. Working part time from home or even the occasional entire day will not be considered as teleworking, but rather a flexible working condition. For the new rules to apply, an employee must work at least 30% of their total hours remotely within a period of three months, which is the equivalent to one-and–a–half days a week. This was the point of greatest conflict between the CEOE-Cepyme business association and Spanish unions UGT and CCOO. Initially, the percentage was set at 20%, but industry representatives pushed for it to be increased to 30%. This was another hotly contested issue during the negotiations. In the end, the decree states that it is up to the company to cover the cost of the provision and maintenance “of all resources, equipment and tools” needed by a worker to carry out their job remotely, according to the terms established in a collective negotiation or in an agreement with the business. The text also states that the company must pay for or compensate a worker for the running costs of this equipment, given that the employee cannot be responsible for covering the expenses for the resources they need to carry out their job. How the company will assume these costs or compensate the worker will be established by a collective contract or via an agreement between the business and the legal representatives of the workers, according to the decree. Yes. The decree states that a written agreement must be drawn up between the worker and the company. The employee has 10 days to deliver this text to their representatives, who then need to submit it to the employment office. Although the details of the agreement will be established in the collective negotiation, the decree says that a “mandatory minimum of content” regarding a worker’s personal needs must appear in the document. The latest draft of the decree lists 11 points on this subject, such as an inventory of the equipment needed to work remotely; what expenses a worker may incur and how they will be compensated; the work schedule and, if applicable, how hours will be divided between the office and teleworking; the site chosen for teleworking; the measures available to the company to monitor the worker remotely; the length of the agreement and work instructions. The draft also states that the agreement must set out how much notice must be given if the situation is reversed. Yes, but the text states that a company may set out time periods when the worker must be available. In other words, the schedule is flexible – in accordance with what is established in the teleworking agreement and the collective negotiation, and as long as the regulations on working hours and breaks are respected – but a company and a worker can negotiate whether the employee must be available during set time periods. Yes. The decree states that teleworking is voluntary for both the worker and the employer. Both parties can also reverse the decision, a right that must be exercised according to the terms of the collective negotiation or the agreement between staff and the company. The decree outlines that within these agreements, the company and worker will also be able to modify the percentage of hours that must be worked on-site, and set criteria and terms to move from working on-site to remotely, and vice versa. Yes, but the last draft of the decree does not clarify how. The test that is set to be approved on Tuesday simply says that a business will be able to adopt measures that it considers “more opportune for surveillance and control” to ensure that teleworkers are doing their job. This may even include remote monitoring methods, as long as they respect the dignity of the worker. Although the government decided to approve the regulation via decree, a faster mechanism than the draft bill initially considered, this does not mean that it will take effect immediately after it is published in the Official State Gazette (BOE). Business associations have insisted on the inclusion of a transitional provision, which by de facto, will delay the introduction of the new rules. This provision was another source of disagreement during the negotiations. The decree states that in situations where teleworking has arisen due to the coronavirus pandemic and the declaration of the state of alarm in March – in other words for exceptional circumstances – it will not be mandatory for workers and companies to sign an agreement. This means that the formal obligations established in the decree are suspended, although the company will have to provide the employee with the resources they need to work remotely. The text also outlines that if the employer and staff already have internal regulations on teleworking, the new framework will only apply once this document has expired. If there is no set period for the internal rules, the new decree will come into effect one year after its publication in the BOE, although both parties can agree to wait up to three years before applying the new rules. The decree states that remote workers will have the same rights that they would if they were working on-site. For this reason, the text states that teleworkers can not be disadvantaged in terms of financial retribution, post occupancy, working hours, training or professional promotions. The decree recognizes that a teleworker has the same rights regarding work-life balance and joint responsibility, and also guarantees the right to disconnect. English version by Melissa Kitson.

2020-09-17, 06:34 UTC,"Fearing new coronavirus lockdown, Spaniards look for bigger homes outside of the city",economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-17/fearing-new-coronavirus-lockdown-spaniards-look-for-bigger-homes-outside-of-the-city.html,"During the 99 days of Spain’s lockdown between March 15 and June 21, most people’s lives unfolded within the confines of their homes, many of which failed to meet the new dual demands of family life and teleworking. According to the real estate sector, this has led to a shift in the general perception of what a property should have in the way of essential features. Now with the number of coronavirus cases continuing to rise, the fear of a new lockdown has led to a significant increase in searches for more spacious properties away from the city. The main real estate platforms describe this new trend as yet another fallout of the coronavirus crisis. “At the end of July, the increase in demand for locations outside the big cities, particularly Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, had risen by 17%,” says Emiliano Bermúdez, deputy general manager of the Don Piso real estate business. “With a second lockdown in mind, people are demanding a specific type of product. They are looking for homes with a balcony or access to community areas that allow them greater freedom of movement and space.” According to Ferran Font, director of analysis at the real estate site Pisos.com, while price is still the main priority when buying or renting a property, the importance given to other features has changed. “During and after the confinement, 60% of people felt they lacked something in their home – 35%, a balcony and 20%, a garden,” he says. Another indication that more people are keen to get out of the city is that removal companies are experiencing intense activity after business was suspended during lockdown. “Right now there is an incredible stampede at the inter-provincial level,” says Santiago Pérez, head of the removal company, Portes 365 Días. “Many people know that they will not be working from now until the end of the year and, as they perhaps have a house in a small town somewhere, they are going in droves to sit out whatever is coming our way.” According to the online real estate platform Idealista, the percentage of searches corresponding to property in provincial capitals fell to 38.8% during the 14 weeks of lockdown, compared to 44.1% in January. However, once the state of alarm was over, this rose again to 40.4%. “There is one essential stipulation right now and that is that the home has a balcony. More than 80% are looking for that,” says Lola Alcover, secretary of the General Council of the Official Associations of Real Estate Agents of Spain (COAPI). “There is also far greater interest in properties with a garden and land plot in the commuter belt, but far enough out that there is no population pressure. And we have detected an increase in interest in the energy rating of housing,” she adds. “While it figured before, only a small percentage gave it any importance. Now that people have spent a season locked in their homes 24 hours a day, they have become more aware of the cost of heating a home and also the importance of good sound insulation.” América Hernández has just made the decision, together with her husband Javier, to move with their two small children from their rented apartment in the Salamanca district of Madrid to a much larger home in San Sebastián de los Reyes, 18 kilometers north of the capital. “After being stuck between four walls, we have realized that there is no point in having a bar or a store close by if you do not have space for the children to play and where you can feel a little more relaxed,” she says. After deciding to make the change, they found a lot of others had the same idea. “We noticed that when a house with the characteristics we were looking for went on the market in this area, it was snapped up,” says Hernández. “Before we found this one, three that we were interested in were snatched right from under our nose.” According to Anaïs López, director of communications at the Fotocasa real estate platform, while searches for homes with a balcony or garden have increased by 40% compared to pre-pandemic figures, searches for country estates have risen 46%; villas, 36%; and townhouses, 24%. Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, searches for apartments have fallen by 14%. “The change in tendencies is particularly noticeable with regard to the rental market,” she adds. “If, before the pandemic, 34% of those in the market were seeking to rent, that’s now 39% – the same as those wanting to buy [also 39%]. And, during the months of confinement and deescalation, 42% of those renting were looking for another property.” Another factor behind this trend is the shift remote working, which has made distance from the city center less of an issue. “Those who can telework and realize they will continue to work remotely after the pandemic is over consider it another reason to get out of a big city,” says Bermúdez. And, according to Anaïs López: “Teleworking will make a big difference to where we live. Since we won’t have to live near the office, it will give us more freedom to leave the city and move to more remote areas. Teleworking will also mean many families having to find a home with more rooms, as having an office space will be more important than ever.” English version by Heather Galloway. ",['Gorka R. Pérez']

British competitor James Teagle, who was in third place, missed the bend and ran into one of the metal barriers lining the route, having become disorientated by the signage at the final meters of the race. Diego Méntrida, a 21-year-old Madrileño, had been close to his competitor during the final stage, just a second behind, but on seeing his error decided not to take advantage of it, letting the Briton cross the line before him – in the process giving up what could have been the first podium of his career. “Seeing him make the mistake, I unconsciously stopped myself,” the Spanish triathlete explained after the race. “He deserved it,” he added. His rival was not just anyone – Teagle is a promising up-and-comer in the sport in his native country, having finished third in the Alanya ETU Sprint Triathlon European Cup, among other strong performances. Diego Méntrida, meanwhile, has only been competing for a year in the sub-23 category in the Ecoesport club in the Madrid municipality of Alcobendas, an activity that he combines with his studies in sports science and physiotherapy. The coronavirus pandemic, however, interrupted his strong recent record, meaning that he was not able to attend races. Despite this, he has continued to gain relevance during the lockdown thanks to his good results in virtual events organized via the Zwift application, a multiplayer program that allows cyclists from all over the world to compete in real stages without leaving their homes. After the sportsmanlike gesture in Santander, the two triathletes will compete together once more next week, at the Bilbao triathlon, also in northern Spain, and which will be held on September 26. Back in 2012, another Spanish athlete, Iván Fernández Anaya, helped a Kenyan competitor across the finish line to win the race during a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. Abel Mutai had stopped 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line. Fernández Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai’s mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.

Finally they opened a fruit and vegetable store in 2001 that would hit the jackpot: today, Frutas Azahara has a chain of 41 stores, almost all located in the Madrid region. “My husband is very much in love with my name,” jokes Azahara from her spacious office at the company’s headquarters in Griñón, 35 kilometers south of the capital. The couple now oversee a small empire built from scratch with an annual turnover of €28 million and 250 employees. It is a demanding business that involves long days from 3am to 10pm, but it has provided them and other immigrants like them with a springboard to a better life in Madrid. Several of these businesses have evolved into chains with dozens of stores. The main players are Frutas Azahara; Don Fruta, founded in 2008 by three friends of Chinese origin; and Dhaka Frutas, also set up in 2008 and run by Alamin Miha, who is from Bangladesh. This line of business is one that Spaniards have increasingly turned their backs on due to lack of enthusiasm from the younger generation, which is put off by the strenuous nature of the work. Azahara Arif and her husband have had an easier time convincing their daughter Lamia, 24, to join them. Lamia speaks four languages, holds two master’s degrees, and is now the financial director of the family business. She is extremely ambitious and plans to continue opening stores in other provinces as well as moving into online sales – something that the recent months of confinement has pushed up the agenda. Like her parents, she is a reserved person, although unlike them she finally agreed to be photographed. While all three are embarrassed by the unsolicited attention, Lamia is proud of her parents and is easily persuaded to tell their story; she says she hopes that their example will serve as an inspiration to others who come to Spain with little besides their dreams. “If someone just told me about it, I would find it unlikely, but I have seen it with my own eyes,” she says, adding that she was already accompanying her parents to the market garden in Griñón at the age of three. “I would like to encourage anyone with a project in mind not to give up. You can achieve whatever you want if you are motivated.” For these fruit and vegetable entrepreneurs, the key to success has been hard work but also expansion. Until the turn of this century, there were no fruit vendors with dozens of stores. But in the past 20 years the competition has gotten tougher. The boom in immigration also brought many young people to Spain who saw an opportunity in the sector. The stores are relatively easy to set up as they require few permits and little investment. All that is needed is a place to rent, a set of scales and the will to get up at the crack of dawn to buy the fresh produce in the wholesale market, Mercamadrid. The hardest part is having to then stay in the store until the end of the day. The bigger businesses have a competitive edge. With more stores, they are able to buy more fruit in Mercamadrid at lower prices; it’s not the same buying 10 boxes of peaches as 10 crates. Consequently, they have been able to survive in an increasingly challenging market, made more so by large supermarket chains moving into city centers and residential zones in the form of “express” outlets that sometimes operate 24 hours a day. There is no official census of fruit and vegetable stores in Madrid, but according to estimates by retailer associations, there are about 2,000 in the region and 1,300 in the capital. The economic crisis is currently seeing all kinds of stores in Madrid shut their doors, but new fruit and veg stores keep appearing in the vacated premises. Many are run by immigrants hoping to strike it lucky. In a process of trial and error, they open and close and open again until they find someplace where the business takes off. If a small operation sets up close to a chain, the competition can be too much. But the larger businesses have an unspoken agreement to respect each other’s turf. “I’m not interested in going into another group’s territory because it can end up in a price war,” says Miguel Salido, the general director of Don Fruta, which boasts a network of 70 franchises that buy from their 6,800-square-meter warehouse in Getafe. Salido worked as an IT specialist in Mercamadrid until 2010, when he was approached by Don Fruta’s three partners, Wang Xianyong, Zhu Yongwei and Yang Xiabobo. All three were about 20 years old at the time and had just arrived in Madrid. Ten years later, their turnover is €22.7 million. “They have made it through sheer hard work,” says Salido, 53. “The three of them are lifelong friends who went to school together.” There are a handful of stores run by Spaniards, but even these few are thinking of throwing in the towel. “It could be two weeks from now, if someone with money comes along,” says Julio García Vivas, 57, who runs the Ay Madre la Fruta chain. He and his cousin, Alfredo García, are third-generation fruit sellers, but they don’t have anyone from the next generation to take over their 28 Madrid-based fruit and vegetable stores. Some veteran fruit vendors have tried to make the work more attractive to their potential successors by lobbying Mercamadrid to change its hours so they can start the day later, but to no avail; the authorities don’t want food distributors coinciding on the road with the morning rush hour. As well as its fruit and veg stores, Frutas Azahara also operates as a producer and wholesaler out of a large warehouse in Griñón, where restaurant owners and other stores come to buy their fresh produce. Some of it is imported from Morocco – their watermelons from Agadir and Zagoura are particularly successful – and some is cultivated on several hectares of land on the outskirts of Griñón. The owner, Mouhy Eddine Azzi, impressed Mercamadrid’s businessmen from the start because it was obvious that he knew what he was doing. “They are reliable, meticulous people and that is very important because it’s a product that gets spoiled,” says Andrés Suárez, an official at Asomafrut, the association of wholesalers in Mercamadrid. “He knows the sector, has invested in production and makes good decisions. They are an example of the great things that good work can lead to.” The owner of Ay Madre la Fruta agrees. “The basis of this business is hard work, and it is clear that no one has given these people anything on a plate,” he says. On the second floor of Frutas Azahara, the administrative staff have their heads down while the founders allow themselves the luxury of a shorter day. Azahara Arif says that her husband had a heart attack recently and, at 63, now clocks off after a seven-hour shift, allowing himself a little free time to enjoy what he and his wife have built up.

2020-09-04, 13:52 UTC,How the Spanish Tax Agency followed the trail of Shakira,economy_and_business,/economy_and_business/2020-09-04/how-the-spanish-tax-agency-followed-the-trail-of-shakira.html,"Inspector Susana C. delved deep into the workings of Shakira’s day-to-day life in Barcelona in a bid to prove that her main place of residence was Spain, where she failed to pay tax, and not, as the Colombian singer claimed, the Bahamas. The inspector knows that Shakira received private French lessons, that her zumba teacher was called Betsie, that she got her hair done twice a week, and that her expenses at El Corte Inglés, restaurants and hotels were paid by her assistants using American Express credit cards. She also discovered that when she went to the Teknon medical center where her children were born, she did so under the pseudonym of Sila Prieto. Shakira’s real name is Isabel Mebarak Ripoll; that is the name she uses for her tax returns. According to the extensive report drawn up by Susana C., and to which EL PAÍS has had access, Isabel Mebarak Ripoll settled in Spain in 2011 after beginning her relationship with Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqué. First she rented a place from the long-distance swimmer David Meca. Later, she moved to the center of Barcelona with Piqué where they lived until buying a house together in the exclusive Esplugues neighborhood, near Barcelona FC’s Camp Nou soccer ground. Like a Spanish Colombo, Susana C. established the singer’s movements between “clinics, beauty centers, recording studios, promotional events and interior and fashion stores.” She also tracked down the social media sites – with names such as I Love You To Death – used by the artist’s fans who tag her every move. Ironically, their zeal has helped to stack up the evidence against her. In 2011, these sites indicated she was in Spain 60 times – far more than in any of the 37 other countries she visited that year, none of which happened to be the Bahamas. The Caribbean island of Nassau occupies a central place in this story that, according to the inspector, has also been shaped by a total lack of cooperation from Shakira. Instead, the singer is said to have stuck steadfastly to her version of events despite providing no evidence to back it up – namely, that she did not become a resident in Spain until the end of 2014 when she was already the mother of her first child, Milan, and pregnant with her second, Sasha. Until then, the artist maintains she lived in a house bought in Nassau for $1.1 million, providing a permanent residence permit granted by the Bahamas in 2007 as proof. However, as Susana C. points out, the only requirement for such a permit is the purchase of property; the more expensive the better, because “if it exceeds a certain amount, the paperwork is pushed through faster.” Spain’s head tax office began to feel like a war room. Shakira provided electricity and water bills as well as proof of payment for cable television services in Nassau. But it turned out that these bills had been paid by a company and the people running them up were the employees she had hired to take care of the property. Central to the investigation was Shakira’s former partner and manager, Antonio de la Rúa, who voluntarily came forward with information. Their love story came to an end in 2010, the year Shakira met Piqué while recording the music video for Waka Waka, which coincided with the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, which was won by Spain. After being ditched as Shakira’s manager, De la Rúa filed a lawsuit in New York, demanding $100 million from the singer for helping to create “the Shakira brand.” Susana C. got hold of his court statement, in which he said he would keep the Bahamas’ house and that Shakira had “sent her assistants to collect her belongings.” Bureaucracy alone has flagged up the fact the Bahamas residence was used merely for fiscal purposes as residents in Nassau are not required to pay tax on income earned elsewhere. But it is Shakira’s personal life that has served to complete the puzzle. The inspector claims to have a clear picture of Shakira’s private world – involving her parents and siblings, her assistants, the director of the Barefoot Foundation, not to mention the accountants, stylists, producers, friends from the US and even her trusted doctor in Colombia. All of them, at some point between 2011 and 2014, paid her a visit in Barcelona; and most came from the US. “If she really lived in the Bahamas, it would have been much easier for them to visit her at her Nassau residence,” Susana C. writes in her report. But Shakira was not in Nassau for even a day during that period. Nor has she provided any evidence, such as airline tickets, that she was. And, as the inspector points out, she does not have “any professional, family, personal or social ties” with the Bahamas. During the period under investigation, she traveled all over the world to give concerts, record shows and shoot commercials. But, no matter how long some of those trips were – she was in the US, for example, for several weeks a year to record the talent show, The Voice – the tax authorities consider them to be “sporadic absences.” At the end of the day, when the work is done and the vacations over, home is Barcelona. But Susana C. still had to prove that Shakira spent half the year in Spain plus the requisite one day – the criteria to be considered a tax resident. Information on the singer’s visits to both a beauty salon in the upmarket neighborhood of Sarrià in Barcelona and the Teknon medical center were obtained. Getty Images, which regularly photographs her professional and personal life, was asked where and when certain pictures were taken. Data was compiled on the concerts organized by Live Nation in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Bilbao in 2011, a big year for Shakira as she completed her Sale el Sol world tour. The inspector also established the exact days she rented the Mandinga recording studio in Sant Feliu de Llobregat that belongs to the Muñoz brothers from the Estopa rock band while the Codorníu wine and cava company revealed the dates when Shakira recorded a music video with Maná in the Cavas Rondel del Penedès in Barcelona. It was also established that Shakira’s hairdresser did her hair at her Esplugues home twice a week, free of charge. And the children’s elite school let it be known that Shakira was one of those regularly dropping her kids off in the morning and also the one who would “usually” go to the parents’ meetings. Credit cards have also been essential to building the case against the singer. Shakira’s brother Antonio, whom Shakira identified during the inspection as “coordinator of her security teams,” and three of the singer’s assistants spent €418,046 in 279 establishments over four years in Barcelona. The payments correspond to services used by people who are, in theory, US residents but above all by the singer herself – restaurants, pharmacies, cabs and hotels; and also Anna Kieser, the trainer who “got her in shape after the pregnancy,” according to the report. A bill from the Santo Mauro Hotel in Madrid, paid for with the card of a collaborator, literally states: “Paid for by Shakira.” The result of Susana C.’s detective work is a blow-by-blow account of Shakira’s life, which is exhausting just to look at. The tax authorities are trying to prove that her base camp was always Barcelona during the period under investigation, despite her trips abroad. In 2012, for example, Shakira went to FIFA’s Ballon d’Or football gala in Zurich and the NRJ Music Awards in Cannes; she recorded a commercial for Puig in South Africa, had a break in Italy with Piqué, went to California to record the music video Addicted To You, attended the Summit of the Americas in Colombia, visited her family in Miami, accompanied Piqué to the UEFA Euro 2012 soccer championships in Poland, recorded the auditions for The Voice in the US and even gave a concert in Azerbaijan. She spent August away from the cameras at her in-laws’ home in Cambrils in Barcelona, pregnant at the time with her first child, who would be born on January 22, 2013. The other years follow a similar pattern from which Susana C. was able to reconstruct Shakira’s global business empire, consisting of up to 14 companies, some in tax havens that turned out to have no staff or material substance, suggesting a smokescreen to hide Shakira’s millions. The first clue that led to the unraveling of this opaque structure was once again given by the singer’s former lover and manager, Antonio de la Rúa. The key year is 2008 when Shakira handed over her image rights to a company in the British Virgin Islands, which transferred them – for one euro – to another company in Luxembourg. It was this Luxembourg company called Ace Entertainment that signed a contract with Live Nation, which guaranteed Shakira €300 million over 10 years. Her first tour with Live Nation was Sale el Sol. The singer reached an agreement with the Luxembourg authorities to pay 2% tax on her profits. The rest made its way back to the British Virgin Islands and, from there, to a company in the Cayman Islands called Carpe Diem, which moved the money into the singer’s pocket. The tax authorities conclude that Shakira is guilty of evading tax on both her income and assets over a period of four years. However, her highest-earning year, 2011, when she was riding high on the success of the World Cup and her world tour, is not liable for prosecution because the statute of limitations for those alleged tax offences has expired. The singer has already paid the €24 million she failed to pay during that year in tax to settle the matter. Meanwhile, the authorities are focusing on 2012, 2013 and 2014. In those three years, Shakira made a profit of €34.9 million and failed to pay €14.5 of that to Spain’s state coffers. She is now being charged with six counts of fraud. Last summer, she testified before the judge and continued to claim that she did not live in Spain; that she did not live anywhere in particular, in fact; she was here and there, she said – “a nomad with no roots.”  ",['Jesús García']

All four were fans of the Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, and had traveled to Madrid to watch their team play against Atlético de Madrid on March 15, 2016. On Wednesday, a Madrid court tried them for humiliating four Roma women who were begging in Plaza Mayor. A video made by two students at the UAM-EL PAÍS journalism school showed the women picking up coins that had been thrown onto the ground by the Eindhoven fans, and being goaded into doing push-ups in exchange for money. On Wednesday, the accused accepted a three-month prison term and to pay €1,500 to each of their victims. The public prosecution was asking for a one-year prison term and €600 in damages. But neither the accused nor the victims showed up in court. Instead, the former made statements via video link and apologized for their behavior, saying that they had had too many drinks that day. As for the victims, they are now living in Romania, according to Carmen Santiago, president of Kamira, the national federation of Roma women. Santiago said that the association will ensure the four women get their money. The defendants also sent a letter to Kamira, explaining that the atmosphere in Plaza Mayor on that day “was jubilant and accompanied by lots of beer.” As for themselves, they were “feeling good and full of confidence in the good outcome of the match.” The incident took place at midday, at a time when the popular square was filled with people. The soccer fans were sitting at an outdoor table having beers when a group of panhandlers showed up. Every time they threw a coin on the ground and a woman picked it up, the visitors yelled “Olé” amid great laughter. Miguel Ángel Rendón, a high school teacher from Cádiz, also witnessed the scene with his students. “They were treating them like animals, and the women were shoving and almost hitting one another as they competed for the coins while the Dutchmen laughed,” he said. “They were giving them five-cent coins. And the worst of the worst was when they threw pieces of bread on the ground.” English version by Susana Urra. ","['Juan Diego Quesada', 'El País']"
2020-09-16, 07:22 UTC,West Nile virus outbreak in southern Spain claims fourth victim,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-16/west-nile-virus-outbreak-in-southern-spain-claims-fourth-victim.html,"The West Nile virus outbreak continues to claim lives in southern Spain. The latest victim is an 87-year-old woman who died after succumbing to meningoencephalitis at Puerto Real hospital in Cádiz province. She is the fourth person to die from the virus in the region of Andalusia, and the first victim reported in Cádiz, where five cases have been confirmed, including three patients who have been hospitalized and one who is in intensive care. The West Nile virus, which is mostly spread by the common Culex mosquito, causes a death rate of 0.1% among those infected, inflammation of the meninges and the brain (meningoencephalitis) among 1%, and a controllable fever among 20%. Last week, transmission of the virus began to be detected in Cádiz, with three patients admitted to Puerto Real hospital from different areas in the province. Until recently, all cases had been recorded in Seville province in municipalities on the banks of the Guadalquivir river, where mosquitoes are commonly found. In Seville there are 24 cases of the virus, with seven patients in hospital and three in intensive care. The presence of the West Nile virus in Cádiz was the topic of the first videoconference between the government delegation in the province and local mayors in the area. At the remote meeting on Monday, authorities agreed to establish two risk zones, one situated in the municipal area of Puerto Real and another in the triangle formed by the towns of Alcalá de los Gazules, Benalup-Casas Viejas and Medina Sidonia, and with the bordering municipalities of Vejer, Conil and Barbate, where the environmental conditions are favorable to mosquito larvae. The next step will be to inform the public of what measures should be taken to prevent mosquito bites. Authorities will then move to eliminate the adult mosquito population and to control the insect’s larvae. This second phase of the plan was launched on September 7 in Seville province, with drones used to fumigate the marshes and rice fields on the banks of the Guadalquivir river. The initiative was carried out by the Andalusian regional government, which fast-tracked a €100,000 contract to complete the fumigation work. At the beginning of the outbreak, the regional government was reluctant to assume responsibility for the disinfection work, despite calls from several mayors of the affected areas, such as Coria and Puebla del Río. At their insistence, the Andalusian government agreed not only to take charge of the fumigation work this year, but also in the coming years, according to the action plan to control the mosquito population that was presented by the regional health department early this month. Although the West Nile virus outbreak appears to have stabilized, experts warn that it could continue to cause more fatalities. English version by Melissa Kitson. ",['Eva Saiz']

Judge José de la Mata of Spain’s High Court (Audiencia Nacional) has sent a request for judicial cooperation to US authorities as part of his probe into a Spanish private security company named UC Global S.L. and its owner David Morales, on allegations that this firm secretly recorded Assange’s private meetings with lawyers, politicians, relatives and journalists at the embassy, where he took refuge in 2012 to avoid separate legal proceedings against him in Sweden. Morales was arrested a year ago and released pending trial. According to testimony from several protected witnesses and former UC Global workers who gave evidence in connection with the case, Morales provided the CIA with recordings, video material and reports detailing the activities of the 49-year-old Australian cyber-activist inside the diplomatic mission, where he lived until his eviction in April 2019. Judge De la Mata, who is heading the probe into UC Global, has asked US prosecutors for the IP (Internet Protocol) addresses of the computers or other networked devices that allegedly connected from American soil to a server held by the private security firm at its headquarters in the southern Spanish city of Jerez de la Frontera. That server stored all the recordings made by cameras at the embassy, where UC Global was in charge of security, as well as reports drafted by company employees detailing each visit that Assange received, images of the visitors' passports, and photographs of their cellphones and electronic devices. According to testimony by several ex-workers as well as e-mails used as evidence in the investigation, US intelligence services allegedly had access to this central server. US prosecutors have now sent a letter to María de las Heras, a liaison judge for Spain in the US, asking her to convey their demands to De la Mata. These include showing proof that the requested IP addresses are “relevant and substantial to the investigation.” The document requests further details about the Spanish probe, including the sources of information for most of the assertions made in the request for judicial cooperation. The Spanish judge has been asked to answer a long list of questions regarding every aspect of his investigation, including who he believes that Morales was providing information to, or whether the judge thinks Morales was working for a foreign information service or as an agent for a foreign power – or whether it was simply a case of bribery. US prosecutors have asked for all this information to be relayed before October 16, otherwise “we will assume that Spanish authorities are not interested” and the request will be shelved. The alleged espionage on Assange by UC Global was revealed in 2019 by an EL PAÍS investigation that uncovered numerous illegal recordings made while the WikiLeaks founder was living at the Ecuadorean embassy. Assange’s defense later took legal action against Morales, who is a former member of the military, and against his company. Morales is currently being investigated for alleged violations of privacy and client-attorney privilege, as well as for bribery and money laundering. The cyber-activist was evicted from the embassy after Ecuador withdrew his asylum status, and since then Assange has been held at London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison. He is fighting extradition to the US, where he is wanted on 18 charges of espionage and computer misuse that carry a maximum penalty of 175 years. WikiLeaks’s publication of secret US military documents shed light on war crimes by US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq; the organization also revealed thousands of diplomatic cables and released an operations manual for the US prison at Guantanamo, among other disclosures. Judge De la Mata has just summoned Michelle Wallemak, the former head of operations at UC Global, to provide testimony in court as one of the suspects under investigation in his probe. Wallemak allegedly ordered the company’s security personnel to carry out some of the espionage activities against Assange. English version by Susana Urra. ",['José María Irujo']

Speaking after a face-to-face meeting with Madrid regional premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso to coordinate measures against the spread of the coronavirus, Sánchez indirectly alluded to the state of alarm that kept Spaniards mostly confined to their homes between mid-March and mid-June. “We must be prepared to consider other scenarios if necessary,” said the leader of the Socialist Party (PSOE), who heads a minority government in coalition with the leftist Unidas Podemos. Sánchez added that because of its situation and characteristics, “Madrid needs a special plan.” The meeting on Monday between Sánchez and Díaz Ayuso signaled a thaw in tense relations and sought to provide an image of coordinated action in what is now Europe’s hardest-hit region. Sánchez insisted on the idea of unity. “Together we will prevail. This is an epidemiological battle, not an ideological one.” The two administrations have made it clear that they will work together, but that Madrid will have the final word. “There are very tough weeks up ahead,” warned Sánchez, insisting that the regional government will maintain all its powers and continue to make the bulk of the decisions. Díaz Ayuso had been a vocal critic of the Sánchez administration throughout the three-month national state of alarm, claiming that the central government was not letting regional authorities handle the health crisis effectively. But a spike in outbreaks over the summer months, after powers had been fully restored to the regions, evidenced that the Madrid government had not prepared sufficiently for a second wave despite pledges to do so during the deescalation process. More than one in five hospital beds in the region are currently occupied by Covid-19 patients, the region’s primary healthcare system is stretched to the limit, and there are still not enough contact tracers to manage the crisis. “Madrid knows what it has to do, but it lacks the resources,” said Díaz Ayuso on Monday. Less than three months after the end of deescalation, Madrid officials last week called on the central government to get “actively involved” in containing the spread of Covid-19. The comments followed a chaotic week for the Madrid government, which is run by a coalition between the conservative Popular Party (PP) and Ciudadanos (Citizens), with support from the far-right Vox, due to a communications blunder. After resisting new restrictive measures, Díaz Ayuso on Friday announced selective lockdowns in 37 areas of the Madrid region where incidence is in excess of 1,000 cases per 100,000 people. The measures, which came into effect on Monday, affect around 855,000 residents, or 17% of the population of the Madrid region. The restrictions triggered a wave of weekend protests by local residents who claimed that working-class neighborhoods are being unfairly targeted. The Madrid region has once again become the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in Spain, accounting for more than one third of all new reported infections. The 14-day cumulative incidence of Covid-19 in the Madrid region is more than 600 cases per 100,000 people, compared to the national average of 267, according to the epidemiological report published by the Spanish Health Ministry on Friday. “The epidemic is becoming stronger in a very worrying way. Only with joint action will we be able to overcome this situation,” said Díaz Ayuso at Monday’s press conference. After emerging from the regional government headquarters in Madrid, Sánchez and Ayuso said they have agreed to create a permanent joint working group that will make recommendations on a weekly basis to Spain’s health minister, Salvador Illa and to Madrid health chief Enrique Ruíz Escudero. Both sides also agreed on the need to shore up Madrid’s primary healthcare system, which is once again under tremendous strain. Reinforcements were also announced for contact tracing teams, disinfection personnel and police to ensure that the selective lockdowns are observed. On Friday, Sánchez insisted that from now on it will be up to regional leaders, not the central government, to request a state of alarm in their territory if they feel it is necessary. Díaz Ayuso said that she is prepared to do whatever it takes, but that for now she does not see a Madrid-wide lockdown as a solution. “That would be death for our region. We cannot shut down all of Madrid without giving ourselves a chance,” she said. “We’re going to try out this plan, and if it works, it will be extended to other areas.” English version by Susana Urra and Melissa Kitson.

2020-09-15, 15:01 UTC,Spain drafts bill against remaining legacy of Franco era,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-15/spain-drafts-bill-against-remaining-legacy-of-franco-era.html,"The Spanish Cabinet on Tuesday approved a draft bill containing a raft of measures that address the legacy of the Civil War (1936-39) and the Francisco Franco regime, which lasted until the dictator’s death in 1975. The Democratic Memory bill, which builds on existing historical memory legislation, contemplates closing down associations that still glorify the late dictator’s memory, including the Francisco Franco Foundation, which will be declared illegal. The text also proposes extending eligibility for Spanish citizenship to the descendants of members of the International Brigades, who fought on the republican side in the war. “The descendants of the members of the International Brigades who fought for freedom and against fascism in Spain will be eligible for Spanish nationality. It was time for this government to say to these heroes and heroines of democracy: thank you for coming,"" tweeted Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, who serves as the Deputy PM in charge of social affairs and the 2030 Agenda. Los descendientes de los brigadistas internacionales que combatieron por la libertad y contra el fascismo en España, podrán acceder a la nacionalidad española. Ya era hora de decir desde el Gobierno a estos héroes y heroínas de la democracia: gracias por venir ✊ pic.twitter.com/t8Xy5TgqvQ With this bill, the government also wants to turn the Valley of the Fallen, a controversial, state-run civil war memorial outside Madrid, into a place of collective memory. Last year Franco’s remains were exhumed from the site and transferred to a Madrid cemetery following a long legal battle with the dictator’s descendants. The bill also makes provisions for the creation of a specialized prosecutor’s office for democratic memory and human rights, and for a national DNA bank to help with the exhumation of victims from mass graves, to be funded with public money. Forensic expert Francisco Etxeberria, who has advised the government during the drafting of the bill, estimates that between 20,000 and 25,000 bodies could be recovered from mass graves in the next four to five years. “This is an important law for the government, but also for Spanish democracy,” said Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, of the Socialist Party (PSOE), on Tuesday. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who leads a minority government in coalition with the leftist Unidas Podemos, had pledged to improve on the 2007 Historical Memory law passed under the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, also of the PSOE. But Sánchez will need to secure additional support to get the bill through parliament. On Tuesday, Senator Javier Maroto of the main opposition Popular Party (PP) said that the executive is using this bill to cover up “its management and its lies” in connection with the Covid-19 crisis. But Maroto did not specify whether the center-right party would vote for or against the bill in the Congress of Deputies. Calvo said the law would declare void all the summary trials held in Francoist Spain, honoring a longstanding demand by historical memory associations. Calvo also said that overturning those legal proceedings is the best form of reparation for the political trials that led to the summary execution of “important people such as [Lluis] Companys,” alluding to the president of Catalonia between 1933 and 1940 who was shot by a firing squad at Franco’s orders. Catalan premier Quim Torra had recently asked the government of Spain to apologize for that execution. Additionally, the bill significantly alters the way Francoism is to be taught in primary and secondary schools across Spain. United Nations Special Rapporteur Pablo de Greiff had said in a report about Spain that some schoolbooks described the civil war “in generic terms, perpetuating the notion of symmetric responsibility [by both sides].” “Spanish democracy could not afford one more day without a law like this one,” said Calvo. “Our young people need to know where we come from. They need knowledge about what must never happen again.” Unlike the 2007 law, which did not set out any sanctions for violators, any infringement of the future law will come with penalties that could be as high as €150,000 in the most egregious cases, warned Calvo. In a recent interview with EL PAÍS, Calvo said that the 66 items in the bill lay out the foundation “to build a common democratic memory for all Spaniards.” English version by Susana Urra.

2020-09-10, 09:33 UTC,Echoes of Franco as Spain’s far right tells PM his government is ‘worst in 80 years’,politics,/politics/2020-09-10/echoes-of-franco-as-spains-far-right-tells-pm-his-government-is-worst-in-80-years.html,"Spain’s far right is taking its strategy to a new level. On Wednesday, during the first question time in the lower house of parliament following summer recess, the leader of Vox made statements that reminded many of a phrase uttered by Francisco Franco supporters years after the dictator’s death: “Life was better under Franco.” Santiago Abascal, whose Vox party holds 52 seats, making it the third-largest force in the Congress of Deputies, addressed Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) to tell him that “you head the worst government in 80 years.” This period of time includes the Franco regime, which lasted from the end of the civil war (1936-1939) to the dictator’s death in 1975. The remark was so unexpected that more than one conservative lawmaker stared at Abascal in disbelief, while Sánchez himself initially thought it must have been a verbal blunder. But Abascal later repeated the remark on Twitter, making it clear that it was a deliberate statement. Sánchez reminded Abascal that eight decades after the civil war, Spain is about to pass legislation making the Francisco Franco Foundation illegal. And so the first congressional question time in the era of Covid-19 was filled with unexpected echoes of the past inside a chamber that was half-empty due to coronavirus safety measures. There was another disconcerting verbal attack inside the chamber, although it came in a distant second in terms of shock value. This time, it was Sánchez who surprised lawmakers with a remark against Ciudadanos, the center-right party that could provide the support the executive urgently needs to get its budget plan approved. Spain has been functioning with the same budget since 2018, and the minority coalition government of PSOE and the leftist Unidas Podemos lacks the votes to push the plan through parliament without backing from other parties. On Wednesday, Sánchez stated that “Ciudadanos clearly hasn’t come out of the Colón photograph,” alluding to a picture of an anti-government protest march showing representatives of Ciudadanos, Vox and the Popular Party (PP) standing together in February 2019. That image of “the three rights” was used by Sánchez on the campaign trail ahead of the general elections. The remark surprised Ciudadanos leader Inés Arrimadas, who replaced former chief Albert Rivera in March and has since worked to guide the party back towards its self-definition as a centrist liberal group. When it was time for her to question the executive, Arrimadas fired back with a reproach. “You should show more sympathy for the victims than for the executioners,” she told Sánchez, who on Tuesday had lamented the suicide of a jailed member of the defunct Basque terrorist organization ETA. Later, sources at Ciudadanos said that the explanation for this outburst from Sánchez is that he is simultaneously working on two potential negotiations to get his budget approved: one with Ciudadanos, and another one with the Catalan Republican Party (ERC), a separatist group that wants nothing to do with the pro-unity Ciudadanos. The same sources said that the prime minister will soon have to choose his partner, and that this twin-track approach “is not going to work out for him.” Meanwhile, ERC representative Gabriel Rufián asked Unidas Podemos “to hold on tight, because if you hold on, we will hold on,” in what was widely viewed as an invitation for Podemos to keep pressuring the PSOE to leave Ciudadanos out of the budget equation and work with ERC instead. The coalition partners have been themselves occasionally at odds over whose support they should seek. English version by Susana Urra. ","['Elsa García de Blas', 'El País']"

On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya announced that Spain will negotiate with Britain, Germany and Scandinavian countries to open up travel corridors to the Spanish islands (the Balearics and the Canaries) exempting visitors from the need to self-isolate upon their return. Although summer travel has ended in much of Spain, the Canary Islands, located off the western coast of Africa, are now entering their own high season. “Our wish is to restore the tourist flows as soon as possible. It is an extremely important issue for the Canary Islands which, unlike other Spanish territories, have a winter tourism season,” said the minister in Milan, where she met with her Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio. “Opening travel corridors such as the ones we will negotiate with Britain could help them relaunch tourist activity,” added González Laya. According to the Spanish official, talks will get underway with major source countries for winter tourism to the islands, including Germany and Scandinavian nations. The notion of travel corridors had been floated even before borders reopened following the coronavirus lockdown. Conceived as an essential strategy to shore up international travel to Spain, it was loudly demanded by the tourism industry, which hoped it would help salvage the summer season. But the only travel corridor that was ever created was between Germany and the Balearic Islands. Now, González Laya is taking up the idea again. The minister’s remarks come shortly after London announced a new mobility strategy for some island destinations, including those in Greece, although nothing has been said about the Spanish archipelagos. González Laya said she approved of the UK’s decision to look at territories rather than entire countries when designing Covid-19 measures. The Canaries, while having a lower coronavirus incidence than other parts of Spain, have suffered from country-wide restrictions on travel to Spain issued by foreign governments. In late July, Britain removed Spain from its list of safe countries, delivering a tremendous blow to the Spanish tourism sector by imposing a quarantine on people returning from the country. Other countries gradually began adopting similar measures. González Laya also mentioned Spain’s petition to the European Union for coordinated measures affecting border controls, and defended the need to increase Covid-19 testing while reducing blanket border closures. Spain has asked Brussels to consider territorial differences when describing a member state’s epidemiological situation, as well as the amount of PCR tests that are being conducted, the number of asymptomatic people, and the pressure on hospitals. “This will provide a better picture of the Covid-19 situation by territories,” she said.

2020-09-21, 11:44 UTC,Madrid’s Teatro Real forced to cancel performance after audience protests lack of social distancing ,arts,/arts/2020-09-21/madrids-teatro-royal-forced-to-cancel-performance-after-audience-protests-lack-of-social-distancing.html,"Madrid’s famous Teatro Real was on Sunday forced to cancel a performance of Verdi’s opera Un ballo in maschera due to a protest from audience members over the lack of social-distancing measures. Madrid has once again become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, with the region accounting for more than one third of all new Covid-19 cases. According to one of the spectators, who had a seat in the upper gallery of the opera house, where tickets are less expensive, up to 15 people were seated side by side in this area with no space between them. The spectator told EL PAÍS that audience members complained to the ushers as soon as they saw that they were seated right next to other theatergoers, with no empty seats between them. In a press release, the Teatro Real maintained that capacity was at 51.5%, meaning 905 seats were occupied. The situation became increasingly tense, and many members of the audience began to stamp their feet and clap to express their anger at the lack of social-distancing measures. The commotion became so great that one of the theater managers decided to announce over the megaphone that the performance would be delayed so that anyone who wished to could leave the theater and ask for a ticket refund. The lobby was then overwhelmed with angry patrons, and the police were called in to control the situation. “There were no complaint forms, they had to go to the offices to print them. On the ground floor, some of the seats were closed off, but in the upper galleries, where there are lots of people much closer together, there were entire rows of 15 people side by side,” said one of the spectators. “It’s unacceptable, a lot of elderly people come here and they should take that into account.” The Teatro Real has not clarified whether the level of seat occupation was the same in all areas of the theater. Another audience member, who was seated in one of the front rows on the ground stall, also complained that the theater had not left empty seats. “The entire row was filled, there was not one seat free, we were like fleas. And that’s in the most expensive area of the theater. My companion and I went to the back, where there seemed to be more space.” According to this spectator, after the theater announced that it would offer refunds, the orchestra entered the pit and started to play. The overture was played and some of the first singers came out onto the stage, but the booing was so loud that Italian conductor Nicola Luisotti left the theater and the performance was cancelled. According to a press release from the Teatro Real, the conductor tried twice to continue with the opera but a “very small group insisted in continuing their protest to boycott the performance, and for this reason it was canceled at around 9.10pm.” Under the regulations of the Madrid regional government, the theater is allowed to be at 75% capacity, a figure that, in practice, does not allow safe distances to be established between all audience members. At a press conference for the presentation of the opera, which opened last Friday, the managing director of the Teatro Real, Ignacio García-Belenguer, said that the theater had decided not to sell more than 65% of available tickets to make the public feel safer. Many of the theatergoers took to social media to express their outrage at what happened. “The Teatro Real opera was canceled due to the protests over the overcrowding of people,” Spanish writer Rosa Montero wrote in a message on Twitter. “I was there and it was shameful. There was a total lack of distancing [measures]. And at this time, with 37 areas restricted! We love opera but not like this,” she added, in reference to the new selective lockdowns aimed at curbing contagion in the capital and the Madrid region. The Teatro Real has said that it will open an investigation “into this regrettable incident and will take the necessary measures so that future performances take place normally.” The iconic theater was the first opera house in the world to reopen after its closure due to the coronavirus lockdown and has pioneered the creation of new protocols that allow performances to continue safety while the pandemic continues to affect the country.

2020-09-21, 07:52 UTC,Barcelona’s iconic Sagrada Familia needs ‘miracle’ to meet 2026 completion deadline  ,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-21/barcelonas-iconic-sagrada-familia-needs-miracle-to-meet-2026-completion-deadline.html,"The Covid-19 pandemic has dashed the dreams of completing Barcelona’s famous Sagrada Familia basilica by 2026, to coincide with the centenary of the death of its architect, Antoni Gaudí. Although construction officials had long promised that the iconic temple would be finished by that date, plans have been set back by a lack of visitors, particularly foreign ones, who represent 94% of the total. Entrance fees and private donations finance the temple’s construction, and based on last year’s visitor figures of 4.5 million, the revenue forecast for this year was in the range of €103 million, of which €55 million was going to be used to build several large spires still missing from the top of the building. But following months of coronavirus-related restrictions and a sharp drop in tourism, the 2020 budget has been scaled down to €17 million. “Unless there is a miracle, work will not be completed by 2026 as previously expected,” said Esteve Camps, executive chairman of the foundation Junta Constructora del Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família, which is in charge of preserving and completing the landmark building. Camps spoke at a news conference last Wednesday ahead of the start of the La Mercè festivities in the Catalan capital, which took place over the weekend. During the three-day celebrations, which began on September 18, the basilica offered free entry to 12,000 people. Construction work was interrupted this year on March 13, coinciding with the introduction of a state of emergency in Spain. Camps said that work will resume “in 15 days, or three weeks at the most.” But neither he nor chief architect Jordi Faulí offered a new completion date. “In 2021, with the remaining money, besides paying our share of the salaries of furloughed workers, we will be able to finish the tower of the Virgin Mary, the second tallest at 138 meters high.” These officials said that most of the work on this tower is already done save for 25 remaining meters for the pinnacle and a large 12-point star of glass and steel that will crown the spire and light up at night. “The stone and steel have already been purchased,” noted Camps. “If Covid-19 measures allow it, we’ll have just enough time to complete the Tower of the Virgin Mary in the last months of 2021.” Faulí displayed images of Gaudí's original workshop, which contained scale models of polygonal stars hanging from the ceiling, similar to the one that will crown the tower. Camps explained that in July 2019, the site had a daily average of 15,600 tourists. This year, there were 2,000 visitors in the entire month of July. “If you extrapolate that to the current situation, you will see that we can only open on Saturdays and Sundays, as long as a bare minimum of tickets have been sold, because the security and visitor health costs are double what we make from entrance fees,” he said. “I would like to remind everyone that this building is made possible thanks to private donations,” said Camps, announcing a fundraising drive for November. “There have been worse times; construction was even halted during the Civil War, but to a greater or lesser extent, Gaudí's project continued to become a reality. And now will not be an exception. We remain committed and hopeful. The temple will be completed.” English version by Susana Urra. ",['José Ángel Montañés']
2020-09-09, 06:32 UTC,The story of Madrid’s abandoned ‘beach’ for its working class,arts,/arts/2020-09-09/the-story-of-madrids-abandoned-beach-for-its-working-class.html,"La Playa de Madrid was just 15 minutes from the Spanish capital’s Puerta del Sol square when it was inaugurated. Nine decades later, the distance is the same, but the premises developed by the architect Manuel Muñoz Monasterio in 1932 to create a “beach” in the landlocked city are in a state of complete disrepair. The great leisure project for Madrid’s working class on the banks of the River Manzanares now houses fetid mattresses, crumpled beer cans, rank swimming pools, tattered tennis courts and facilities that are at risk of disappearing altogether. Owned by the state agency Patrimonio Nacional, which manages Spain’s national heritage, La Playa de Madrid has been closed for six years. Defaults in rent payments forced it to close, and it subsequently became the target of vandalism. “There is no longer even any security,” says Juan García Vicente from the green group Ecologists in Action, who is upset by the state of dereliction of a site with social and architectural significance in the city’s history. The access point to the “beach,” which borders La Zarzuela racetrack on one side and the Puerta de Hierro Sports Park (previously known as Parque Sindical) on the other, has not been opened since the authorities evicted staff and members at the end of October 2014. The company running the complex at that time, which belonged to the former president of the Spanish employers association CEOE, Arturo Fernández, received a court order to vacate the premises as it had failed to pay rent or any tax despite operating the five swimming pools, 11 tennis courts, four paddle courts, one roller-skating rink, four frontón courts, the cafeteria, the restaurant and the parking lot. Arturo Fernández has left a hole in the National Heritage agency’s accounts to the tune of €867,006, which will have to be paid as soon as his company’s bankruptcy is resolved. The 3,000 Playa de Madrid members who had paid their fees were also denied access. Fernández’s contract had been renewed in 2011, despite the fact that he was already €466,831 in arrears. It was a sum that, according to the Court of Auditors, “he paid a few days before signing the new contract.” To add insult to injury, EL PAÍS has learned that on July 30, National Heritage filed a complaint in court in a bid to evict the new company running the complex, Centro de Eventos Playa de Madrid, which is also behind on payments. “It has not paid even one month’s rent and has run up a debt of €530,523,” says a National Heritage spokesperson. The new contract went into effect on October 17, 2017, after the president of National Heritage at the time, Alfredo Pérez de Armiñán, decided to lease the 184,800 square-meter property to a company that not only failed to pay rent, but also reneged on a commitment to invest €3.2 million to renovate the complex. Meanwhile, under the National Heritage’s current president, Llanos Castellanos, an initiative is underway to revamp the more than 22,000 hectares of green spaces owned by the institution throughout the country, including the Playa de Madrid complex, which will be finalized when the judicial process ends. “The aim is to turn it into a sustainable property that is financially self-sufficient, and to make sure that what has happened does not happen again,” says Castellanos. The phony beach was fashioned from a shallow river, from which “a beautiful arm of the sea” was created, to quote an ad from that period. But the dam that stored up the water to create a 300-meter shoreline was dismantled this January by the Tajo Water Confederation so that the river could follow its natural course unimpeded, according to García Vicente. “It was a very interesting dam because it still allowed the water to flow and remain clean,” says Alberto Tellería, a member of the Madrid Citizenship and Heritage Association, who still remembers the complex’s dance floor and the announcement of a design competition for cheap evening dresses in 1934. The “beach” was very popular among the working classes during the Second Republic, before Francisco Franco’s air forces razed it. And it was there that the photojournalist Robert Capa constructed his iconic image of of two militiamen greeting each other under the lighthouse tower. But unpaid dues and ignored commitments have proved the ruin of the site, which is these days trapped between two highways. “These are public facilities of extraordinary significance,” says Juan García Vicente, who has been fighting for years for a path that will connect Madrid with El Pardo, on the left bank of the river. This path should be ready in a couple of months and access to the “beach” will be reserved for pedestrians and cyclists. Meanwhile, the dignity of the complex is still to be restored, which according to Carlos Ripoll, a member of the Madrid Architects Association (COAM), has an “impeccable” language all of its own. The simple and modern lines of the structures designed by the creator of the Las Ventas bullfighting ring and the Santiago Bernabeu soccer stadium are hidden behind pines, cork oak and poplars, and they are reminiscent of the international tone set by Swiss architect Le Corbusier. Muñoz Monasterio, who sided with the regime after the civil war (1936-1939), carried out the post-war reconstruction in 1948, refurbishing it according to Franco’s taste, with slate roofs and spires. But the subsequent inauguration of the nearby Parque Sindical (now known as the Puerta de Hierro Sports Park) and water contamination ended Madrid’s dream of having a beach.

The Spanish filmmaker’s brother and producer Agustín Almodóvar shared a 57-second video on Twitter in which the British actress is seen walking silently across a grey background in a bright red dress. The latest project by the award-winning director will officially premiere at the Venice Film Festival, which is scheduled to take place between September 2 and 12 amid heightened coronavirus safety measures. Clip de presentación de La Voz Humana de Pedro Almodóvar. pic.twitter.com/321sAPZMvj Festival organizers said they are also planning to award a Life Achievement Golden Lion to Swinton, as well as to Hong Kong director Ann Hui. A few days ago, Almodóvar stated that he felt like returning to Venice on such a “particular” year. “It is an honor to accompany Tilda on a year when she will receive a special award,” said the Spanish director, who accepted the same prize last year. “The Human Voice is a festival celebrating Tilda, a display of her infinite range as an actress,” he said. “Directing her has been spectacular.” The shared video clip has no dialogue. Instead, viewers hear music written by the score composer Alberto Iglesias, a longtime collaborator of Almodóvar’s. The Human Voice is an adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s 1930 play La voix humaine, which also served as inspiration for earlier work by Almodóvar, including his 1987 Law of Desire and 1988 Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.

2020-08-12, 10:06 UTC,The weekend that the creator of ‘The Wire’ spent arguing with Twitter users about Spain,verne,/verne/2020-08-12/the-weekend-that-the-creator-of-the-wire-spent-arguing-with-twitter-users-about-spain.html,"Pablo Iglesias, the leader of anti-austerity political party Unidas Podemos and one of Spain’s four deputy prime ministers, enjoys a good TV show. A few years ago, he gave a box set of the HBO hit Game of Thrones to King Felipe VI, and has used his Twitter account to rave about the French series Baron Noir, Italian drama Gomorrah and US classic The Wire. Last Friday, Iglesias took to his Twitter account again to recommend another series by The Wire creator, David Simon, called The Plot Against America. Vista “La conjura contra América”. @AoDespair y Ed Burns nunca decepcionan pero el momento en el que ha aparecido la serie le da un significado especial. A veces nos parece inconcebible el éxito del fascismo y, sin embargo, los colaboracionistas están siempre muy cerca. pic.twitter.com/zfaKRIHQJj “I just finished watching The Plot Against America. David Simon and Ed Burns never disappoint but the moment in which the series has come out gives it special meaning. Sometimes, the success of fascism seems inconceivable to us, and yet sympathizers are always close.” Based on Philip Roth’s novel of the same name and released on HBO in March, the series presents an alternative history of the United States in which Republican candidate Charles Lindbergh wins the election against the Democrat’s Franklin Roosevelt, and ushers in anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi policies. What Iglesias hadn’t bargained for was that his tweet would trigger hours of fiery exchange between David Simon and total strangers on the subjects of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and the referendum on Catalan independence, during which Simon would learn the true meaning of the word “olé.” The Twitter storm began on Saturday, when Simon discovered that he had been mentioned in hundreds of messages thanks to Iglesias’s tweet recommending The Plot Against America. Retweeting Iglesias’s message, Simon wrote: “So, if my poor Spanish holds, this fellow liked the bent of a miniseries and tagged me. And so now into a second day, my Twitter feed is full of Francoists and Catalunyans screaming at each other in languages not my own. Well okay. It’s 1937 again. Fuck the fascists. No pasaran [sic]” – a reference to the anti-fascist slogan “They shall not pass.” But this was not the only message The Wire creator shared; he subsequently spent most of Saturday and a good part of Sunday arguing with Twitter users about fascism. He insulted Franco and the Francoists and criticized the United States for having supported dictators during the Cold War. The matter of Catalan independence was also brought up with Simon saying that a referendum, where leaders are “willing to count votes,” was preferable to the coup of July 1936. One well-intentioned Twitter user suggested that Simon refrain from playing into the hands of the trolls, but Simon intimated that he wasn’t having a bad time. “Mock, block and roll. They only get one boquerone. Then I down my vermouth and walk,” he tweeted back. Don't feed the Spanish trolls LOL Not all the exchanges involved insults. Simon also had a more serious debate with the New York-based Spanish writer Julio Valdeón on the question of Catalan independence; he announced that the script for the drama series A Dry Run, which follows the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, is underway; and recommended his favorite film by the Coen brothers, A Serious Man. Simon also made it clear that he didn’t mean anything by referring to Iglesias as “fellow,” adding that he agreed with the prime minister’s comments that fascist sympathizers are never very far away. He did, however, admit that he had no idea who Iglesias was when he first saw his tweet. Others bypassed Simon completely to question how Iglesias, as deputy prime minister and the father of three small children, had time to watch so much TV. The most amusing moment was when one Twitter user addressed Simon with: “Olé tus cojones,” which the Twitter translator gave Simon to believe meant “go smell your balls.” He promptly shot back with “tu madre” – your mother, believing this to be an insult. Twitter users rushed to Simon’s aid, however, and clarified that the word olé does not come from the verb to smell but is rather like saying “bravo” – with the phrase meaning something more like: “Wow, you’ve got balls.” Finally, Simon wound the exchange up by declaring: “Okay, so I’ve wasted the entire morning insulting the mothers and rhetorical paucity of Spanish fascists and Francoists on Twitter. But I have learned that ‘smell your balls’ is actually a compliment. So it’s a bit of a break-even.” Okay, so I’ve wasted the entire morning insulting the mothers and rhetorical paucity of Spanish fascists and Francoists on Twitter. But I have learned that “smell your balls” is actually a compliment. So it’s a bit of a break-even. Meanwhile, Iglesias apologized to Simon for “messing up his Twitter feed,” but said that it was at least an opportunity to ask about A Dry Run. Judging from the recent ruckus, Simon will have to set aside a good chunk of time to responding to messages on Twitter when the show finally comes out. English version by Heather Galloway.

2020-08-21, 10:40 UTC,The forgers of God ,eps,/eps/2020-08-21/the-forgers-of-god.html,"For 80 years, a small Spanish community of Claretian missionaries in Paris has not breathed a word about their bid to save 155 Jews during the Nazi occupation of France between 1940 and 1944. At number 51 bis, on the narrow Rue de la Pompe, just half an hour’s walk from the Eiffel Tower, the Claretian Mission has been hiding hundreds of fake christening certificates that four of its priests drew up and signed in order to prevent the pro-Nazi Vichy French government from arresting dozens of Jewish families. These musty “Christian” identity documents, tucked away in a tiny closet, bear witness to the fact that Gilberto Valtierra, Joaquín Aller, Emilio Martín and Ignacio Turrillas put their lives on the line to take in these Jewish families, facilitate their flight from France, and shield them from the frequent deportations to concentration and extermination camps. Only now has their secret come to light. So many years after the events, there are no witnesses bar the stone walls and the intricate passageways that connect the parish with the monastery. But crossing the wide nave of the parish and observing the statue of Saint John of the Cross or searching through books in the library, it is impossible not to wonder about the steps those Jewish families had to take in order to obtain protection against persecution. Did they enter through the small green side door on the side that gives directly onto the monastery? Did they do so at night? Did they sign the fake documents on the large wooden table in the sacristy? Or did they hide in the crypt chapel? When these questions are put to those living on the premises today, the answer is always the same: “We don’t know. Everyone around at that time has passed away.” So how to piece the story together and rescue it from oblivion? It was a mere snippet of information exchanged in a cafeteria in central Paris in 2018 that led 26-year-old historian and professor at the University of Extremadura, Santiago López Rodríguez, to investigate what really happened in that church run by the Spanish Claretians during the war. “I was researching Spanish diplomacy during the Holocaust for my doctoral thesis in the consulate archive and doing interviews with survivors and relatives of the victims of the Nazi extermination,” he explains. “While I was having coffee with Alain de Toledo, the son of a deportee from the Royallieu-Compiègne camp, he told me that his parents had had their baptismal certificates forged in a Spanish church in Paris to help them flee to Spain.” Toledo offered no further details but López Rodríguez decided to follow the lead and headed for Rue de la Pompe. López knocked at the door of the mission and was greeted by a Claretian with a Burgos accent called Carlos Tobes Arrabal. Tobes led López along a passageway to the small closet where the baptism certificates are kept. In an adjacent office, López inspected each certificate – all registered between 1940 and 1944 – under the watchful eye of the Virgin Fatima. Written in blue and black ink were dozens of Jewish surnames – the names of people who had been born abroad, most of them in Thessaloniki, Greece and Istanbul, Turkey. “It is clear how the number of baptisms in the parish soared by 200% during this time,” says López. “Entire families were converted on the same day, and in some cases, marriage certificates [22 in total] were also forged.” The 155 forgeries happened over a period of five years, between October 3, 1940 and July 12, 1944. There are four in 1940, 68 in 1941, 30 in 1942, 45 in 1943 and eight in 1944 as the Nazi occupation of France came to an end. After dusting off the volumes and deciphering the handwriting of all the signatories, López cross-referenced the mission’s data with what he found in other French archives and found that up to 60 of these documents corresponded to Jews who were registered as Spanish while 19 corresponded to people who had the protection of the consulate. This discovery has now been woven into López’s doctoral thesis The Spanish Foreign Service during the Holocaust in occupied France (1940-1944), which he hopes to publish in the coming months. The Modiano family was the first to be baptized. Maurizio Modiano, 65, his wife Eda Maria, 51, his son Rene, 20, and his niece Maria Francisca Hasson, nine, lived at 134 Avenue de Malakoff. Except for María Francisca, they were all born in Thessaloniki, Greece. There is no clue as to whether Father Valtierra, the priest who signed the documents, used holy water to baptize them or whether he simply took them to an office to sign the documents. What does appear on their records is the date, October 3, 1940, the day that the Statutes on Jews came into force; in other words, the anti-Semitic laws signed by the Vichy leader Philippe Pétain that ushered in a census of the Jews living in France and led to their deportations to concentration and extermination camps. It is estimated that more than 75,000 Jews were killed on account of these laws and the point of these forged certificates was, according to López, to trick the authorities into believing that a conversion to Catholicism had taken place in a bid to save these 155 Jews from the same fate. In clear handwriting, the priests took turns forging the documents and recording relevant data, which, when analyzed now, allows us a glimpse of who those being baptized were. Almost all were Sephardic Jews – the collective that had been driven out of Spain in the 15th century – and the average age was 33, with the youngest being just a few months old, and the oldest, 75. Almost all were given a Spanish name so that when they presented their documentation to the French authorities, they would not be linked to names registered on the Jewish census; Levy, for example, became Luis, Jacob became Jaime and Moses became Mauricio. It is also interesting to see how some, weeks after being “baptized”, appear as godparents to other Jews in the records. The Modiano couple, for example, are recorded as being the godparents on the baptismal certificate of 20-year-old Victor Gomerzano, who had been born in Constantinople – today’s Istanbul. This suggests that, in many cases, those being baptized were related to one another and the Claretians’ secret spread among them by word of mouth. Helping Jews during that time in France was considered a serious crime, especially any forging of documents such as visas, passports or baptism certificates. “These priests were not only breaking Church law by undertaking fake conversions, they were also taking a stand against the French state,” López explains as he reviews the Claretian archive in search of anything that might shed more light on what happened. “If this had been exposed, it would have undoubtedly meant their expulsion from France and a huge blow to Spanish diplomacy.” So who were these four priests and how did they manage to weave their network of salvation? When it comes to hard evidence, little more than a dozen photographs remain of these men, stored in a cardboard box at the Rue de la Pompe mission. But there are those who recall having heard stories about them. Apparently, they lived in the mission together with another 10 Claretians, though they appeared to carry a remarkable amount of weight within the brotherhood. In the fresco above the parish altar, there is a portrait of a priest that, after comparing his face with other portraits and corroborating the evidence with Father Tobes, is clearly meant to be Father Joaquín Aller. Born in 1897 in Campo de Villavidel in León, Aller was then at the head of the Claretians. The local Asturian press at the time reported that he had collaborated with an exiled Asturian communist to return the carving of the Virgin Covadonga to Asturias, after it had spent part of the Civil War in the Spanish Embassy in Paris. He died in Bilbao in 1964. Little more is known about the others. Gilberto Valtierra was born in 1889 in San Martín de Humada in Burgos, a village of 22 inhabitants. He had a family of five brothers, three of whom became Claretians. His great-nephew, Luis Porras Valtierra, still lives in San Martín de Humada. “What do you mean? Did that really happen?” asks the nephew when he receives a call from López. “The truth is that he was a good man. I remember that he once came to the village to see my mother. But, as far as I know, he never said anything about what you’re telling me.” Referring to his great uncle’s death, he adds: “It was November 1, 1953. A few days later we received a letter from France. In it, a family we’d never heard of told us: ‘The poor of Paris are crying at the grave of Father Valtierra.’ I’ve never forgotten that.” Emilio Martín, meanwhile, was one of the founding fathers of the Claretian mission in Paris. He arrived there around 1913 with the aim of helping struggling Spanish immigrants. Born in Segovia in 1869, Martín taught and directed the Claretian brothers at Rue de la Pompe until his death in 1951. Now, as you enter the sacristy, there is a charcoal portrait of him on the left. Tobes, who is the current director of the mission, knew only one of the priests: Ignacio Turrillas, who was born in Monreal, Navarre, in 1897. Tobes nursed Turrillas in his last years. “He was the only one of the four still alive and he died in my arms in 1979,” says Tobes. “He never mentioned anything about this. But one day, years after his death, back in 2008, a woman came to the door saying, ‘I have come to thank you. You saved my parents’ lives.’ No one knew what she meant and we took her to Father Miguel Ángel Chueca, our superior at the time.” When the woman had gone, Chueca told the missionaries the story, though not in any great detail, and asked them to keep quiet about it. “I think it was a story that the order kept to themselves,” says Tobes. “Now, knowing more about what our brothers did, it fills us with pride and happiness.” More than a century after it was established, the mission continues to reach out to those in need. The priests teach French to Spanish-speaking immigrants and provide free social services. But there are few brothers left. Compared to the 20 Claretians in the 1940s, there are now just three. Besides Tobes, the mission is home to Father Tomás Tobes Agraz and Father Arturo Pinacho. “The calling never goes,” says a smiling Father Tomás, 81. “We have to serve because many people are in need.” As they eat a modest stew and drink water colored by a squirt of cheap wine, the three priests talk about the great need so many people find themselves in. No one yet knows why Father Chueca was reluctant to make such a discovery public; why he was still insisting on secrecy when De Toledo went in search of the evidence proving his parents had been “baptized” at the mission. “He gave no reason,” says De Toledo. “I would have liked to have paid tribute to the mission, but he didn’t want me to.” This blanket of secrecy was also respected by the majority of those the Claretians helped. For example, De Toledo’s parents never breathed a word of the episode to him. He only found out about the Claretians’ role in saving Jewish lives when he was investigating how the Spanish Consul General in Paris at the time, Bernardo Rolland, known for saving more than 80 Jews, freed his father from the Royallieu-Compiègne concentration camp in 1942 and then helped both his parents into exile in Spain in 1943. “A cousin of my mother’s, Enrique Saporta y Beja, knew the consul very well,” says De Toledo. “He had lent him an office at the consulate to help the Sephardim. He told me that Rolland was the one who advised these Jews to go and see the priests [to forge the certificates].” The role of Rolland as a link between those being persecuted and the priests indicates that he participated in the rescue of a hundred more Jews than was previously thought, and that he possibly involved workers from the Official Chamber of Commerce in Paris, who feature as godparents on some of the forged baptism documents. “Without him, my parents would not have survived and I would not have been born,” says De Toledo, who is also president of Muestros Dezaparecidos – Disappeared Evidence – an association that works to recover the historical memory of Sephardic Jews during the Holocaust. “That is why I have been trying for 15 years to get him awarded the Righteous Among the Nations medal. But as far as I’m concerned, without or with it, he is one of the Righteous.” Unraveling the story of the forgers of God, one question remains: how did the French authorities not suspect anything, given these documents contained Jewish surnames and, in many cases, a mature baptism age? Did these baptisms really help to save the lives of most of these families? López is convinced. “These documents were the perfect way of concealing their faith and giving more credibility to their Spanish nationality certificates or other papers issued by Rolland,” he says. Accredited by the Church, the baptism certificates could get them off the Jewish census that the authorities later used to make thousands of arrests and deportations to concentration and extermination camps. And, as López points out, they increased the chances of getting a visa to leave France. Moreover, although forgery to save Jews was not particularly common, similar episodes involving the rescue of thousands of people from murder at the hands of the Nazis have surfaced. One example was Operation Baptism, in which Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII between 1958 until 1963, forged baptismal certificates during World War II to save 24,000 Jews in Istanbul, Turkey. In the case of the Claretians, while 138 Jews helped by the priests managed to escape the Nazis, the forged certificate was not enough to save eight-year-old Rogelio Samuel Benarrosch and 16 others from death in the concentration camps. On a number of occasions, the Claretians’ activities caused disquiet among the upper echelons of the Church in France. In correspondence between Archbishop of Paris Emmanuel Suhard and the superior of the Claretians, the superior was asked to go to the episcopal headquarters to explain the baptisms. A letter dated February 12, 1942, from Suhard insists: “I told you, the last time I saw you, that the Archbishop’s Council needed an explanation about another Israeli convert whose documentation has not reached us. It concerns Mme. Saporta, who would have been baptized and married in haste in the Spanish chapel. I would be grateful if you would come to see me on Saturday morning, February 14 at 10am sharp, and give me any documentation you have on the matter.” It is common knowledge that the Archbishop of Paris was opposed to the Vichy Government and to the deportations, so it is reasonable to think that the intention behind these letters was to warn the mission to be careful and to hand over some kind of documentation that would endorse the urgency of these conversions so as not to raise suspicions within the French Church, which supported Hitler. However, no evidence has been found concerning the Archbishop’s position on the forgeries. The current superiors of the order in Spain, who were also unaware of the actions of their brothers in Paris, claim that the forgeries were probably carried out in the strictest secrecy. “The years have passed and it is probable that if other brothers or superiors of the congregation knew of these actions, they would take them to the grave,” says a Claretian spokesman in Madrid. Among the faded papers that the mission still has from that time, there is a copy of another letter that Father Valtierra wrote to justify the baptism of the Sevi family – Alberto, Matilde and their children Jacqueline and Claudio. “I have no reason to doubt Mr Sevi’s good faith about his conversion,” wrote the priest. “Now he behaves like a Christian, he comes every Sunday to Mass [...].” Clearly, Valtierra lied to protect the family. Proof of this is found in the archives of Yad Vashem, the official Israeli institution set up in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. There, it is recorded that years after being baptized Albeto and Matilde Sevi handed their daughter over to their neighbors, the Saulniers, a Catholic couple, for protection. “They were not afraid of the bombings, but of being arrested and deported because they were Jews,” the text says. Fortunately, we know that the little girl was reunited with her parents after the war. Finding and interviewing the protagonists of the top-secret mission is very complex, especially since so many have passed on. After an intensive search of family blogs and family trees, plus more than 500 phone calls, around 20 descendants have been located. Interestingly, none of them knew anything about the Claretians’ role in their lives. “I’m getting goosebumps. I can’t believe it,” says Karine Saporta, daughter, niece and granddaughter of those who were baptized. “It’s like you’re telling me about someone I don’t know. I don’t understand why they never told me anything.” She heard the news after returning a missed call on her cellphone from the author of this article. “I thought it was a joke,” she adds. The Saporta case is particularly noteworthy because the youngest member of the family was called Raimundo. He was 16 years old at the time of his conversion and would go on to become the vice-president of Real Madrid. Not only was he Santiago Bernabéu’s right-hand man, he also persuaded one of the world’s greatest players, Alfredo Di Stéfano, to join Real Madrid while managing at the same time to be involved in the International Basketball Federation. Raimundo’s brother Marcelo, who was Karine’s father, was 19 when the forged baptism certificate aided him in his flight to Madrid. After the war, Marcelo changed his name to Marc and returned to Paris to become an important translator and editor as well as a close friend of Jean-Paul Sartre. The entire family, like many others like them, concealed what had happened from their relatives and took the secret of the Claretians to the grave. A year after hanging up the phone, Karine visits the mission in Paris to take a look at the famous documents for herself. Accompanied by Father Tobes, she climbs the wooden stairs leading to the library at the top of the monastery. Between two book-lined walls is a table with an open volume lying on it. Karine’s knees are trembling and when she sees her parents’ names, gasps. “Here they are,” she says. She learned that her parents were also married there in 1949. Father Valtierra, the priest who signed their fake baptism certificate, conducted the wedding ceremony. “I can’t begin to imagine the suffering that my family was subjected to. It’s a story that people should know about. It must be told,” Karine tells Father Tobes. For Eliazer Carasso, his wife, Matilde Amarigio, and daughter Alegra, the escape from the Nazis did not end with their flight from France. In fact, the journey to their new home in Casablanca, Morocco, would take almost another year to complete. As was the norm, the Franco regime distributed the Jewish exiles among a number of Spanish cities while they waited for their respective visas and the Carasso family were sent to Toledo. Six other Jewish exiles joined them in the capital of Castile-La Mancha, among them Edith María Esther Nahamías, who had also been helped by the Claretians. The details of their journey can be found in a police file in the Provincial Historical Archive of Toledo. Both hand-written and typed by the civil governor of the province of Toledo, the documents specify the accommodation the exiles would use from August 1943 until their departure in December of that same year. The Carasso family lived with a local family at number 2, Escalerilla de la Magdalena street. Justa Córdoba, then 13 years old, still remembers the exiles as “educated people” who were “well dressed” but that “they only talked among themselves.” The years have passed and for Córdoba, now in her 90s, the memories are fading. “I was very young,” she says. “In the neighborhood, it was said that they were Jews that Franco had taken in as refugees.” In December, the Carasso family managed to take a boat from Málaga to Casablanca. A month earlier, Nahamías was able to secure a safe passage to Barcelona where she was reunited with her husband, Jacob Faraggi. The couple settled in Madrid not long afterward and opened a fashion boutique near the Plaza de la Independencia. According to Anne-Marie Rychner Faraggi, who was related to both, they returned to France in 1945. “They went back after the Second World War,” she says. “Our family doesn’t know much more about them.” Each name has a story behind it that helps to shed light on one of the blackest periods of the 20th century. But despite the Claretians’ secret coming out into the open, much of the detail remains a mystery. For example, did they take the initiative to save these people or was it the consul who knocked on their door asking for help? Did the bishop agree with their actions or was he simply unaware of what was really going on? And were the Claretians’ forgeries the key to keeping most of the baptized from being killed by the Nazis? After analyzing the certificates, the letters and the other reports over and again, there is no doubt that the Spanish missionaries at Rue de la Pompe exposed themselves to great risk from the Nazi authorities – but, as their unerring calligraphy reflects, they did so with a steady hand.

2020-07-10, 16:00 UTC,Fernando Simón: dissecting the public face of Spain’s coronavirus crisis,eps,/eps/2020-07-10/fernando-simon-dissecting-the-public-face-of-spains-coronavirus-crisis.html,"Silence... Not just any silence, but the kind you get in critical situations, as if to pull them back from the edge. It was that kind of silence that fell when Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, decided to freeze all non-essential economic activity during the state of alarm, after a meeting in La Moncloa, the seat of government, at the end of March. This is how Fernando Simón, the expert who had just assumed a fundamental role in the crisis, remembers it. He sat next to Sánchez and several other decision-makers and said, “If measures are not taken to reduce the risk, the death toll could be in the hundreds of thousands and the health system could collapse.” Sánchez, who heads a coalition government made up of his Socialist Party (PSOE) and the leftist Unidas Podemos, had asked him for his opinion as the situation in Italy spiraled out of control. Catastrophe was looming on all fronts. Decisive action was called for. Simón had been issuing warnings for several days as the health crisis escalated globally. He and his team from the Health Alert and Emergency Coordination Center (CCAES) had analyzed the possible scenarios. He issued the warnings again. And it was then that the prime minister took the decision to tighten the lockdown and paralyze the country’s economic activity even further. “At that moment, I felt like 300 kilos of stone was bearing down on me. I also put myself in his [Sánchez’s] place and thought: ‘What an incredibly brave guy,’” he says. The silence seemed to confirm that the country was closed for business – a country within a continent that was also being sealed off, within a world facing an abyss of uncertainty. Fernando Simón was there. Although his role at the heart of the crisis may have seemed incidental, this doctor from Zaragoza, who will turn 57 at the end of July, had been preparing for just such a scenario, the worst that could hit a developed country. Now the hypothetical had suddenly become a reality. He was there, in the room where the most difficult decisions were reached; decisions that would have a huge impact on people’s lives and future. He was the one giving the instructions that would trigger that impact – an unavoidable course of action, one that nobody wanted. “In situations like this, the only thing to focus on is on what you can do. Forget about what you want, put it out of your mind,” he says. That March morning, he probably arrived at the Ministry of Health on his motorbike at around 7.30am. The bike is a Suzuki he bought years ago from a friend for €1,000. “I like to fix what isn’t broken, instead of throwing it away,” he says, and referring to the leather jacket that is older than the bike, he adds, “I bought it in 1991 and it’s still in perfect condition. It cost me 50,000 pesetas at the time [about €300].” Within the ministry, he would have headed to the CCAES headquarters, as he has done almost every day since former Popular Party (PP) Health Minister Ana Mato appointed him agency director in 2012. EL PAÍS SEMANAL spent two days with Simón and his team, which currently consists of 15 people, including doctors, biologists, nurses and data specialists. Since his appointment, Simón has dealt with several crises, the most notorious being Ebola in 2014, although there were no fatalities and only one infected person in Spain. It caused a stir, but nothing in comparison to the coronavirus. In fact, the Covid-19 crisis is unrivaled in that respect. “We had been expecting a major pandemic since the beginning of the 21st century,” says Simón. “This is it.” By the second week of March, Simón and his team were working without respite. When the situation was at its worst, the CCAES team was expanded to 24 people. Each member needed all their strength to cope with the unrelenting demands of the task confronting them, one that kept them flat out day after day, night after night, weekend after weekend. “We were in the hands of the best specialists in their field in the country, with the best contacts in the world,” says Simón. “Without them, we would have gotten nowhere. On March 9, we realized the situation was out of control. The scenario in Italy was a sign of what was to come.” But what about before that? What about the signs coming from China? Was that just Western arrogance? “We thought we knew more than we did – enough to control it. But the reality is that we didn’t detect it fast enough to stop it,” says Simón, sounding repentant. He is alluding to Spain, but also to the rest of the EU. Experts from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control also underestimated the risks at a highly controversial meeting on February 18, when the pandemic was about to take hold in Italy. “We started to assess different possible scenarios there,” says Simon. “I honestly don’t know how many infected people I had in my head then, but they never reached the almost 250,000 we have now in Spain.” Apart from the mortality rates, the main fear was that the health system would be completely overwhelmed. The big question at that point was how many cases were already circulating in Spain, and to what extent a tsunami of cases could be dealt with. So, did the system break down? Simón thinks for a moment, then says, “No, not on a national scale; in specific areas, almost. But when it came, there was a capacity to respond. There was a period of time when 55% of the beds across Spain were being used by coronavirus patients.” Now the focus is on fresh outbreaks. The first day that EL PAÍS entered the CCAES headquarters, following the end of the state of alarm, there were 13 active outbreaks. The worst was over and Simón had been able to stay home for three consecutive weekends. “And to get sleep, a lot of sleep,” he says. His wiry frame is recovering the strength that once sustained him on the rugby pitch and now serves to pull him up rock faces. Simón is in permanent contact with regional government authorities, and keeps abreast of any potential outbreaks. On his desk, the folders pile up. One of them is entitled “Future World.” What does it contain? “Ah, that’s a secret,” he says. Future projections – perhaps similar to those he was making 10 years back. “Ten years ago, while drawing up response strategies, we put ourselves in the worst-case scenario for a developed country, and that is basically what has happened,” he says. Hopefully, this folder will also set out solutions, ways to avoid more disaster. In the meantime, Simón measures, reflects, and thinks about the strategy that has been employed. He counts and recounts and examines the figures over and again. “They mean nothing in themselves,” he says. “First, you must be familiar with the sources, which must be reliable and checked. And then the data must be used for specific purposes. Producing data is very complex, much more so than handling it.” So to what extent can we trust the data? Something about Simón’s reaction suggests the question makes him uncomfortable. He was severely criticized for his vacillation during certain phases of the crisis, and for changing the way that the data is measured. He would like to apply to politics the scientific logic used to analyze data. “What is one more or less when we’re talking about 28,000 victims?” he says. “Does it make a difference? According to some journalists, one death is news but 1,000 deaths are statistics. The data is useful if it helps to understand the problem and provide solutions. Our work is not about individuals, but populations. We put the puzzle together with the information that the regional governments provided us with. We have been obsessed with checking their reliability. They have all done and continue to do an exceptional job.” While coordinating with regional authorities, Simón has nurtured the kind of work ethic that knows no limits. “I don’t have them,” he says. “I don’t think anyone does. And if they do exist, you have to try to forget about them, not give them the slightest chance. Boundaries are there to be overcome, just like dogmas.” This is the essence of the man. “He has always done what he wanted to do, but with a spirit of serving the community” says Health Minister Salvador Illa, who has had time to become acquainted with Simón in particularly challenging conditions. Both Illa and Simón share a serenity, evident in the past few months, that seems infectious. “I couldn’t lose my cool,” Simon says. “When you have to explain dramatic scenarios to those who have to make the decisions, you have to do so very calmly so they really understand what is important. But you also have to make them see the uncertainties attached to each of the possibilities.” Simón has both the experience and the psychology for the job, the latter undoubtedly inherited from his father, a psychiatrist who is now 89 years old. “He has been an incredibly active man who has managed to recover from two big blows, being widowed twice,” he says. “He asks me a lot of questions; at times he feels worried about me, and at times he feels proud.” Simón’s mother died when he, the second of six siblings, was eight years old. Simón has a wealth of experience when it comes to extreme situations – his career as an epidemiologist has taken him to Burundi, Somalia, Tanzania, Togo and Mozambique. “When you have to go to a hospital in Beira [Mozambique] to control a cholera epidemic and, as soon as you arrive, you can see the medical team is useless because they do nothing but cry, what do you do? You convince them that even if hundreds die, they will save thousands, and that’s how you restore their morale.” He has also worked in Guatemala and Ecuador, and been inside the classrooms of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in the UK, and the Institut de Surveillance Sanitaire in Paris. His wife, Maria Romay-Barja, and their three children have accompanied him on almost all his travels. In Paris, apart from learning how to manage different scenarios, he signed up for a course on communication. “We left quickly,” he says. “We thought it was absurd. They were obsessed with talking about what they call the win-win strategy, with trying to get us to eat each other alive like sharks. They based everything on image, they even told us what kind of clothes would suit us.” They also inquired about his hair and his response was the same as it is today: “I stopped combing my hair when I was 15.” As for color schemes, they probably didn’t recommend the grey or muted shades of blue he has worn throughout the crisis, along with the un-ironed shirts. “The iron came in handy at one time because it was used to kill bugs,” he says. “Then washing machines and detergents were invented and did a good job with the clothes, and now the iron has become a tool for image and domination. Who irons? Women, generally. I don’t even know where the iron is in my house.” Simón’s style of communication is not to be found in textbooks, which may have something to do with the fact he has become an unlikely pop icon who has t-shirts made for him, gifts sent to his office, and even busts sculpted in his image. But while he inspires overwhelming confidence in some, his critics feel an equally crushing measure of aversion. This is undoubtedly because he does not play to the gallery, calculate strategies or use social media. “There’s a confusion regarding the press conferences,” he says. “I am not speaking to the journalists. I direct myself to the public.” So, with his disheveled appearance – including stubble, and hair and eyebrows that rarely see a trim – he has managed to develop a strange complicity with a section of the public. Dressed in sweaters and jeans, and looking more like a hippy than an executive, his media appearances throughout the crisis contrasted sharply with the appearances from members of the military and police with their medals and stripes. “In fact, I’ve tried not to learn any protocol,” he says. “I want to make sure it does not stick.” According to Salvador Illa, both communication and leadership are among Simón’s innate qualities. “In that sense, he already has the attributes that are taught by experts and which many, despite their efforts, never achieve,” he says. “He also has a natural charisma with his teams and, above all, he is a good person. There is no doubt about that when you deal with him.” The only thing that concerned Illa in in the past few months was Simón’s use of his motorbike. “His obsession with the bike: I had to get firm about that,” he adds. “When tension and risk were at their peak, I didn’t like him moving around on the motorbike, and I told him so. And I didn’t let him use it when we were going to La Moncloa. I said, ‘Do us the favor of getting into the car, Fernando!’” But for Simón, the daily trips on his Suzuki give him the space to think. “When you get to the office, you unfortunately don’t have much space to reflect, to stop and examine things quietly,” he says. “I do that on the bike.” Salvador Illa was determined to take care of Simón at the height of the crisis and his heart sank when he heard the doctor had contracted the virus. “Fortunately, it was only a few days,” says Illa, who even remembers the exact date he tested positive: March 30. But Simón’s symptoms were mild and during his recovery, he was able to keep a handle on the situation. “I didn’t even realize I might have it,” he says. “I thought it was fatigue. I spent a night with a bad cough and a day with a temperature, that’s all. My children left food at my door – they were wonderful about it. And the neighbors would bring us torrijas [French toast], as it was almost Easter. I don’t know how I will ever be able to thank them.” Simón returned to his post on April 14, just as the lockdown was beginning to produce results. But the question remained – why did Covid-19 cause so much havoc in Spain? “Its impact on a national level has been massively influenced by what happened in Madrid and Barcelona,” says Simón. “This is logical, as they are gateways for most people coming in. It then affects the surrounding towns. That’s why, along with Madrid, its neighboring regions have been worse hit. Also, along with Japan, Spain is the country with the shighest life expectancy. So we have a very old population that has been devastated by the virus. To a large extent, this explains our situation.” It’s a scenario he believes is now under control. But he doesn’t yet know the toll it has taken on him. He believes that he still hasn’t had time to digest what has happened, and this is evident when he speaks about the most tragic and heroic aspects of the crisis. “When you find yourself in situations like this, you mourn each of the dead, you take them with you,” he says, his eyes tearing up. “You also think about what you have managed to avoid. But I’m not stupid: what really gets to me are the 28,000 dead. I find it hard to accept. I’ve seen people die, many people, every day, in countries where I’ve had a struggle on my hands; young women who die in the delivery room, with six children that you know for sure do not have a father to take care of them. It’s harrowing. We epidemiologists do our crying at home. We have the armor to withstand things. During these months, I have cried, often for the living as well as for the dead; for the silent heroes, those in lockdown who have lost almost everything and are the ones paying for this without really being able to; for those who, without owning anything, take food to their neighbor because they have even less. Those are the ones who really get to me.” Simón stops talking. His grey eyes look red. His voice is hoarser than usual. “F***!” he says. “Now I’ve started crying. Get lost!” As he sits on a terrace in Huertas street, next to the Ministry of Health, strangers continually approach to thank Simón, a man who has more than his share of detractors on social media. But, over the space of three hours, there are no insults, only gestures of affection and encouragement. “You see, I can hardly go outside. I find all this overwhelming and I am eternally grateful. Why me? I just do what I have to do.” The fact is that going out with Fernando Simón is like being with a celebrity – which he perhaps wouldn’t mind if the status was related to music. One of his passions is rock and roll and playing the bass guitar. “The Beatles, yes – the whole family likes them – but also Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, and Spanish bands, Juan Perro and before that Radio Futura, of course... And all the singer-songwriters. Who can deny that [Joaquín] Sabina is a poet? And, of course, Labordeta. Just saying his name gives me goose bumps.” While he graciously accepts affection, he also manages not to let the criticism, particularly when it involves politics, bring him down. “I haven’t done any courses to help me understand political strategies, but I watch films and read newspapers,” he says. “The key to discrediting those in power is to attack the experts with whom they work. That can lead to some low blows, but I prefer to look the other way.” Simón has his own strategy to deal with this kind of thing, he says, explaining, “I make a constant effort to look naïve and act surprised by the meanness. I don’t accept it for what it is, as with the buccaneers who dominated the health market when things were really bad. Now less so, but they are around.” It’s a different story though when the criticism comes from the field of science. “That hurts more,” he says, perhaps referring to comments made by Pedro Alonso, the biggest malaria specialist, who said the crisis had not been well managed. Did he feel Alonso was alluding to him? “Pedro is a great expert on malaria, but health emergencies are not his strong suit,” says Simón. “Maybe he got a little carried away for other reasons, although I didn’t mind.” Despite the criticism, Simón feels confident about the coming months. “I think we will be able to control the new outbreaks,” he says. “We now have the resources to contain a possible new wave of the virus, health resources, which the crisis has depleted, and which I hope we have learned to resolve. We have to reverse the capacity of our health system. That is one of the main lessons to be learned from this situation.” While remaining on high alert, Simón hopes to spend some days this year in Caspe, Zaragoza, the town where he spent almost all his summers as a child. Once there, he will be able to relax – though not entirely – with his extended family. “There could be 30 of us,” he says. “We’re a very close family.” Meanwhile, he believes that he is already moving out of the glare of the spotlight that has been shining his way over the past months. “In a little while, I know that nobody will remember me,” he says.

2020-04-24, 16:25 UTC,La Paz: a Madrid hospital at war against Covid-19,eps,/eps/2020-04-24/la-paz-a-madrid-hospital-at-war-against-covid-19.html,"Juan José Ríos, the medical director of La Paz hospital, walks briskly through its labyrinthine corridors. “It’s been hard, but you have to keep your spirits up,” he says. “Every day, it’s as if three planes had crashed. We’ve had 800 patients and more than 250 waiting to be admitted into the emergency ward.” Ríos walks by an area generally filled with people waiting for their appointments with various doctors. The place is deserted. Another area normally used for doctor’s appointments is now being used for testing staff members who could be infected. They sit and wait with drawn faces and a constant dry cough that is recognizable and highly contagious. The pandemic has turned Spain’s best-rated hospital and an icon of the country’s public health service into an immense machine dedicated to Covid-19. There were plans to deal with the disease, but reality intervened. The first patient to be diagnosed with the virus at Carlos III, which is part of the La Paz hospital complex, was a 24-year-old male admitted on February 25. It seems like a century ago. Today, almost 90% of the hospital complex is dedicated to the coronavirus. As its manager, Rafael Pérez Santamarina, says, “La Paz is a hospital at war.” Entire departments have been transformed; redundant areas have been turned into intensive care units (ICUs): the on-call system has become the shift system and they have laid out meters and meters of oxygen tubing as its use has increased seven-fold. Crisis meetings are held every morning and new decisions taken on a daily basis. And specialties are no longer as relevant as they once were, with doctors signing up from more than 30 departments. “There’s been a revolution,” says Ríos as he makes his way to the surgery block to show us wards that have been converted into ICUs. The corridor is narrow and cluttered with tables for medicines and medical instruments. There’s an area dedicated to waste materials that needs to be given a wide berth. A lot of people are on the move, some carrying bags, others looking intent. The bustle is overwhelming. Several nurses are disinfecting the ICU exit. They scrub the floor and spray themselves with a pink liquid called Virkon that is present everywhere here: it is a potent virucide that they sprinkle like water on their gloved hands, their suits, masks and shoes. This virus has put around 750 healthcare workers out of action, approximately 10% of the workforce. Behind the nurses are beds on which a dozen patients lie inert, surrounded by cables and tubes connected to ventilators, their lives hanging by a thread. You can hear the beeping of their devices. Suddenly someone shouts, “There’s a [cardiorespiratory] arrest!” A healthcare worker rushes down the corridor and enters the ICU. Seven people gather around the patient. The panic lasts several seconds. “They have just saved that person’s life,” says Ríos, moments later. “With this disease, people start out with few symptoms. But after seven to 10 days, they develop pneumonia that can be very severe and causes respiratory failure.” Ríos then takes us along more corridors until we get to a wing of operating theaters also converted into an ICU. As with army units in war movies, each ICU has its own approach. This one is run by an anesthesiologist from the children’s wing of the hospital, Luis Castro, who explains, “We are a bit saturated. In each operating room there are three patients with ventilators normally designed to run for just a few hours during surgery.” They have 11 critically ill patients here with severe bilateral pneumonia. Several are upside down. “It’s a position that helps the patients – the pronation,” says Ríos. “That’s how you get more oxygen to poorly ventilated areas of the lungs.” Another anesthesiologist shows us a diving mask that is being tested on patients. A team has been working on adapting it. “Everyone here contributes something,” he says. There’s no time to delve deeper: Ríos is already heading to another corner of the hospital. “We’ve converted 20-odd floors,” he says as he goes. “And they’re all full of people with pneumonia.” En route, we pass through a room where the surgical instruments are being stored. Close by, a nurse rummages through boxes of medicines while outside there is a cloud of fog that comes from the immense oxygen tanks. “The consumption is tremendous,” says Ríos. These are the lungs of La Paz, working at full capacity. Soon we are in the original ICU, the one that existed before the pandemic. Eva Flores, a 49-year-old intensive care physician, looks exhausted as she stands at the entrance to a roomful of people on ventilators. A pregnant patient has just died. “How are we doing?” she asks rhetorically. “Badly. There are a lot of problems with beds; we’re assessing about 50 patients a day.” “We have a lot of work. But it seems we’ve got passed the peak,"" adds Juan Carlos Figueira, 53, head of the intensive medicine department. ""This week, we’ve noticed an improvement in the ER.” His glass-walled office overlooks the ICU. While he’s talking, a patient goes into cardiorespiratory arrest. “We’re hoping that what is happening in the ER will be a sustained trend,” he goes on. “And that it will be reflected among the critically ill patients. La Paz has made a huge effort. We now have 149 beds for the critically ill.” Below, they manage to revive the patient and a nurse leaves the room, clearly distressed. The microbiology department analyzes between 500 and 600 samples a day, although there have been spikes of 770. These samples are kept behind a door with a sign that reads: “Warning. Biological hazard.” Julio García, who is in charge here, calls it “the machine room.” He has good news. “There have been times when all the samples coming from the emergency ward were positive,” he says. But today, April 1, there are around 40% fewer samples testing positive than there were 10 days ago. The crisis meeting starts first thing in the morning in a conference room. The heads of the various departments sit down, leaving empty seats between them. Everyone is in a gown and mask. The medical director opens the session and they go over the figures: 822 admissions, 63 beds free, 12 spaces in the ICUs. They comment on the difficulties they’re having receiving equipment due to problems at customs. They assess the possibility of opening and transforming a new area. The head of the emergency ward is asked how things are going. “We’re doing well.” There’s laughter. “We’re still on a downward trend in terms the number of patients,” explains Ríos. “It’s the first morning we have had good news.” The head of microbiology adds that the percentage of positive diagnosis continues to drop. The intensive care specialist Manuel Quintana, who coordinates the 120 volunteer doctors coming from different departments, closes the session. And everyone returns to their posts. Shortly afterwards, Ríos takes us in the elevator to the pulmonology department on the 12th floor. This floor, he explains, is the precursor to the intensive care unit, the place where patients receive lesser degrees of support for their battered lungs, such as double pressure masks. “We try to keep them here as long as possible to put off the moment when they go to the ICU,” explains the pulmonologist Ana Santiago. In the hallway, various healthcare workers push a machine used to take chest X-rays. In the wards, you see patients on different types of ventilation. Those who have the strength for it look at their cell phones. Others shrink behind their masks. On the floor above is the internal medicine department. In the supervisor’s room, Cristina Marcelo, a resident doctor, has just recovered from Covid-19. She returned to work two days ago after almost 20 days off and was confronted with a barely recognizable, interdisciplinary set-up in which specific areas of expertise are no longer relevant. A colleague sits down close by to deal with paperwork. “Death certificates,” he says. Two patients have died in the last five minutes. “Due to the pneumonia, oxygen levels get so low that the body stops living.” Outside, rooms are open on either side of the corridor. In one, an old woman is sitting with her back to us on the edge of the bed. Her hair is white and disheveled. She blows her nose and replaces her mask. Her figure is silhouetted against a large window overlooking the mountains north of Madrid. It is a bright day. “Here, you can see the loneliness of the sick,” observes Ríos. “They don’t have their relatives. It is difficult for them to be here in their final moments.” Francisco Arnalich, head of the internal medicine department, has his office on this floor. Between him and his pulmonology colleague, they coordinate 14 floors dedicated to the coronavirus. With his window open, Arnalich describes the whistling sound made by the tiny air sacs in the lungs called alveoli once they have been hardened by the inflammation. “Whoever said this was a flu was wrong,” says Arnalich. “This disease commands respect.” Patients, he explains, are treated with oxygen therapy; with antibiotics; with an anti-inflammatory called hydroxychloroquine, which is used against malaria and lupus. Sometimes they are given a biological agent – a monoclonal antibody. And an experimental antiviral treatment called remdesivir is also being tried. Between 2 pm and 3 pm, the patients’ families are called and given updates. “Sometimes they are allowed to come,” he says, adding by that stage in the day the health workers are starting to get tired. “We will hold out, we will survive,” says a sign on the ground floor. Ríos passes it on his way to the last ward he wants to show us. Here, another ICU was set up in the space of four days. Set apart from the other ICUs, they have named it Perejil, after a rocky islet off the coast of Morocco that belongs to Spain. A handful of doctors crowd in front of computers here. Behind them is a window and, behind that, are beds filled with the critically ill. One of them is not responding to intubation, so they prepare to perform a tracheotomy. A nurse leans on the glass and watches the operation, in case she is called upon to do it herself at some point. “This is a hard place to be,” she says. Her name is Marta Martínez. She is 28 years old and the red mark on her face from the protective eyegear accentuates the tiredness in her eyes. Behind her, another health worker is putting on protective clothing. For many in the hospital, one day is indistinguishable from the next. José Ramón Arribas, head of the infectious disease section of internal medicine and coordinator of the high-level isolation unit, doesn’t know if it’s Wednesday or Thursday; April 2 or April 4. What he does know is that it’s day 37 of the epidemic. He saw the first patient to test positive in Madrid and has only had one day off since. “This virus is capable of destroying the health system,” he says. “It is highly contagious, unpredictable regarding who is going to come out of it better or worse, and capable of infecting healthcare personnel in a way we have never seen before. From a biological point of view, it can produce a systemic reaction: at first it is viral, but in the second week the organism can go haywire. A cytokine storm occurs, which makes the body go into overdrive to stop it, attacking the lungs, the heart and the clotting system. And that’s why a significant number of patients end up in the ICU.” Having also belonged to an experienced Ebola team, Arribas adds, “Looking back, all other crises seem banal. This is like HIV, but in fast motion. Nothing will ever be the same after this.” Soon after, there is a change of shift for the internal medical team. The doctors explain who will be in charge of which floor. Then they update those coming on duty. Elena Trigo, a specialist in tropical diseases and imported pathology, complains that the support team that arrives from other departments barely lasts a week; no sooner have they been trained than they disappear and it’s time to start over, forcing those left behind to double their shifts. The people in charge shrug and say they’ll come back to it. Meanwhile, Fernando de la Calle, a specialist in infectious diseases, invites us to visit him on his floor. In spite of everything, De la Calle has not lost his sense of humor. He has “opened” so many new areas dedicated to Covid-19 that he jokes, “Along with the Queen, I am the person who has cut the most ribbons this year.” We are given special footwear to put on before entering. The corridor is long and in one of the rooms Roberto Casado, 59, can be seen behind his door, preparing to go home. “I’m excited,” he says, coughing from time to time behind a mask and maintaining a safe distance. He himself is a nurse at Carlos III where he helped to treat the nursing assistant Teresa Romero, one of the few Ebola cases in Spain back in 2014. Casado was also among those treating the first patients with coronavirus. But he’s not sure if he caught Covid at the hospital. “My wife started with the symptoms first, and three days later, my daughter and I got them. But while they got better, I started to nosedive,” he says. It didn’t seem serious until he realized he could barely speak; that he was suffocating. “And I’ve run marathons,"" he says. “I thought I wasn’t vulnerable because I was fit. But at times I felt like I might not make it. Because I wasn’t able to breathe. You don’t appreciate the simplicity of air going in and out of your lungs until you lose it.” Casado has spent the last seven days in the hospital, during which time he was medicated with one of the new experimental treatments. He’s been off oxygen for three days and, after having a fever for 12 consecutive days, has been free of it for two. He hasn’t had a test to confirm he is negative, but as soon as patients stop showing symptoms, they are sent home armed with hygiene and isolation measures. “It’s a treacherous virus,” he says. “But it’s not Terminator,” adds De la Calle, who walks us out and sprays the soles of our shoes with the pink virucide. Around 9 am, a session of mindfulness run by the hospital’s psychiatric team begins in an area next to the emergency ward. The doctors are told to get into a comfortable position and close their eyes to connect to “the stillness within the storm.” A small bell sounds  ting, then a voice says, “I observe my mind and bring it back.” Ting. “I notice how my breath goes in and out, something so precious, thanking the body for doing this.” The session is brief. The doctors return to the fray. “We do it to train the mind in stress management and so make fewer mistakes,” explains Beatriz Rodriguez Vega, head of psychiatry at La Paz. “It’s about surfing the wave in the middle of the storm.” Until a few days ago, the emergency ward was one of the hospital’s hot spots. The influx was relentless, with nearly 500 patients a day and more than 250 pending admission. “There was no end to it,” says medical supervisor Charbel Maroun. “We felt helpless. We knew that no matter what we did, many would die.” Facilities had to be expanded. A waiting room in the form of a tent was set up outside. The old gym became a “mini Ifema,” alluding to Madrid’s convention center, which has been converted into a field hospital. In the meantime, doctors were taking sick – 63% of the medical team. Today, the emergencies section is a complex of wards, cubicles and recovery rooms. Maroun and the coordinator Rosario Torres explain the transformation as we walk down corridors. All around us, the hospital is being scrubbed. Tapes on the floor distinguish areas that are clean from those that are dirty. There are a lot of patients in the rooms, but there is also some space. A few days ago, you could hardly move in these corridors. In one of the waiting rooms for Covid-positive patients is Alejandro Merino, 63. His mother died yesterday of the virus. His father is in a critical condition at 12 de Octubre hospital. When he himself started to notice symptoms, his sister, a Samur ambulance worker, told him to go to the ER and he showed up in the small hours of the morning. “Doctors and nurses are heroes,” he says. Beside him is Laura Fernández, 21, whose symptoms, including a fever, cough and vomiting, started some time ago. She has an oxygen tank next to her, which she has been hooked up to all night. Now it seems she doesn’t need it. If she can manage without oxygen, she’ll be sent home. She appears to smile behind her mask when she says she is a third-year nursing student. A passing healthcare worker observes, “If you were in your fourth year, you’d be working already.” At 23, Laura García isn’t much older. She has been nursing for a year and is standing just outside a cubicle while one of her colleagues wearing protective gear walks around between the patients inside. Hours pass like this. Referring to the past few weeks, García says, “It was chaotic with patients. I got dressed at the entrance [of the hospital] and I couldn’t even get in due to the number of people there. There was no one seeing to them. You had the feeling that you couldn’t do your job properly. It was frustrating.” As they are frequently moving between clean and dirty areas, her team has been the most affected by Covid in La Paz, with 235 colleagues falling ill. Rosario Torres, the coordinator, takes us to the gym, which has been converted into a field hospital. “It has been essential,” she says. By the end of March, they had 90 patients. On the day of our visit, April 3, there were fewer than 40. Torres says she hasn’t seen her children, who are four and six, for weeks. They have gone to stay with their grandparents outside the capital. A woman buzzes around us, checking items off a list. She is the head of Pediatric Ophthalmology. “Here I am in another new role!” she says. “I’m organizing the ambulances.” The intensive care specialist, Manuel Quintana, who coordinates the support teams, explains, “The idea is that there are no more specialties. We are all doctors. Period. That’s the definition of an emergency.” Then he adds, “It’s been two weeks and it seems like we’ve been here forever.” Also working as an emergency coordinator, he confesses that after his shift in the ICU the other day, he had his first ever nightmare. “I was carrying a suitcase, which was very heavy, and suddenly I opened it and there was a dead man inside, one that I had actually seen.” Quintana admits that making decisions in a ward of 40 critically ill patients means you start having “reasonable doubts” about what you are doing. Then he sums up the situation with a line from a song by Quique González – They can’t beat us, but they came close yesterday.In mid-March, at the height of the crisis, Quintana convinced an R-0 team – R-0 being the basic reproduction number by which the intensity of infection is calculated – to go to the research wing of La Paz every day. They sit in pairs on computers and punch out clinical summaries for a database. “It’s our Silicon Valley,” says Quintana. You hear them singing, ‘Lower right lung.’ Then ‘Cardiac? Systolic?’ Joining this team is a Spanish epidemiologist from Columbia University who has returned home to lend a hand. “With data, we will be better prepared to take the next steps,” says Quintana. A jack-of-all-trades, like so many doctors just now, Quintana is also coordinating another R-0 team who are working in a converted-hotel hospital near La Paz, at the foot of the Kio Towers. A four-star establishment, it is now a surreal space such as you might find in a science fiction movie. The lobby has been laminated. Health workers, several of them fourth-year student nurses, move around the ground floor. The hotel has 120 stable patients and 45 professionals who have come from all over Spain as well as abroad to lend a hand. The carpets in the corridors have been covered with easy-clean material. The conference rooms have been converted into warehouses for protective clothing. And in each bedroom, the fake flowers, net curtains and anything else that is difficult to disinfect, have disappeared. Patients are provided with clean towels and a thermometer. One of the best rooms ­– a corner room with a view – is being used for the nursing control desk. Medicines are kept on the shelf above each bed. Sitting by a mirror, three very young healthcare workers say, “We are eager to help.” It’s Friday, April 3, at approximately 6 pm and the medical students have taken the decision to discharge several patients. The first to leave is Valentín Macarro, 80, who steps out of the elevator into the lobby and starts to cry as he expresses a desire to see his grandson. He has been in the hospital for 17 days. He goes out onto the street and blows a kiss in the air. The second, Felipe Andrés, 67, has been in the hospital for almost a month. “We have a health service we don’t even deserve,” he says. The third, Francisco Javier Jiménez, 86, is picked up by his daughter Aurora, who has already picked up her mother at Ramón y Cajal hospital. “I don’t believe it!” she says as the elevator opens and her father steps into the reception area. Her voice breaks with emotion. “Daddy, we’re going home!” she says. They want to hug, but they can’t. They elbow each other instead. The healthcare providers clap. Father and daughter raise a hand in a gesture of gratitude. Then they leave the hotel and reach the sidewalk with tears in their eyes. English version by Heather Galloway. ",['Guillermo Abril']
2020-04-17, 11:49 UTC,Coronavirus: The war of our generation,eps,/eps/2020-04-17/coronavirus-the-war-of-our-generation.html,"An icy rain falls on the city of Madrid. The streets are deserted. The scene is desolate. The capital is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Spain, with senior residences and care homes one of the major focal points of the pandemic. On the outskirts of the city, in a residential area of Alcalá de Henares, 48 paratroopers stand under a shower of rain that turns to snow and covers their black berets in white. An accumulative lack of sleep has caught up with them and there is not much in the way of chat. The courtyard of the senior care home has been turned into a parking lot for military vehicles. The paratrooper brigade has been there since dawn, and is ready to follow orders to disinfect the place. At least three staff members at the center have already contracted the coronavirus, and a couple of very elderly residents are showing symptoms and are being isolated at one end of the building. Through a window, one of them looks to be in a terrible state, but no one knows for sure if they have the virus as they have not been tested. The paratroopers’ decontamination mission is vital. The vast building, with 180 rooms and 200 residents, is believed to have a high viral load. Second Lieutenant Carlos Infante, a veteran nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) defense specialist who is leading the operation, rolls his first cigarette of the day and addresses his unit. “We’re going to wait until the seniors have finished their breakfast, then confine them to the dining room on each floor, then we’ll go in,” he says. “It’s a big job, it’ll take 12 hours.” A drop of rain soaks his cigarette and he looks up at the sky. At this early hour, other units from the large military bases on the outskirts of Madrid are on similar missions. So far, they’ve disinfected more than 2,000 residences. It’s a high-risk assignment and they know it. But they do it every day. “What happens if we’re afraid of catching the virus? We can’t be. What we are doing is the most fundamental act of solidarity. Otherwise, what are we good for?” says a young paratrooper. Convoys of vehicles filled with troops and decontamination material cross the ghostly capital, stopping at traffic lights. The Guadarrama XII Brigade, stationed at El Goloso military base where they keep Leopard battle tanks with cannons that have a 30-kilometer reach, is now on a mission to disinfect residences in Colmenar Viejo and Galapagar, north of Madrid. And the Military Emergency Unit (UME), the so-called “invention” of former Socialist Party (PSOE) prime minister José Luis Zapatero, which has been assisting in land, sea and air emergencies across Spain since 2005, is heading for the commuter towns of Alpedrete and San Sebastián de los Reyes. The military units disinfect an average of 200 residences a day. The demand is relentless. In every corner of this devastated city, the military transports the sick and the dead in their hundreds. They build field hospitals and shelters for the homeless. They work at the field hospital in Spain’s Ifema convention center; they patrol the streets both alone and together with the Civil Guard and the National Police and try “to protect, offer security and instill confidence.” In other parts of the country, they are also protecting essential infrastructure, such as nuclear power plants, as well as manning Spain’s borders, flying in medical resources and helping Spaniards trapped abroad. They clean and patrol hospitals, airports, train and bus stations, and public buildings and they hand out water and food. They have even helped turn military vessels into floating hospitals. And since the epidemic began, nearly 300 members of the armed forces have contracted the virus. They work without schedules. They eat when they can. They’re on the frontline. “We are here to help; it’s good for Spaniards to see what we are capable of and what we are doing with their taxes,” says General Rafael Colomer, head of the Guadarrama XII Brigade. “Supporting the civilian authorities is part of our annual training plan, and you know, you fight the way you train.” Colomer is currently monitoring the deployment of 1,300 soldiers and 300 vehicles from the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) of his headquarters, where the walls are covered with maps of Madrid. He is in constant contact with the Buenavista Palace, the headquarters of the General Army Barracks in Madrid’s central Plaza de Cibeles square, which assigns daily duties to army personnel across Spain. During the military coup d’état on February 23, 1981, the Guadarrama XII Brigade, which formed part of the famous “Brunete” 1st Armored Division, was ordered by Lieutenant General Jaime Milans del Bosch to occupy Madrid and destroy democracy. Forty years later, on this gray morning, the same unit is in the city to help the public and carry out tasks not under the remit of other authorities, such as cleaning, building, transporting and patrolling. This time, their weapons are not just guns, but cloths and mops. Lieutenant Elvira Barbasán, who has not yet turned 30 and already commands around 100 gunners, is upbeat about the job at hand. “The best thing about all this is we’re standing by Spaniards in these tough times, interacting with them, being useful, which they clearly see and understand,” she says. “This is something that does not happen very often to us in the military and it is very gratifying. The citizens don’t know much about us. And it is a chance to offer some insight.” Her boss, General Colomer, explains that one of his units is in Barcelona disinfecting the region’s public buildings, from airports to police stations. Meanwhile, members of other units are working in the Basque Country and Valencia. “There hasn’t been a single problem,” he says, despite the fact Catalonia and the Basque Country are regions with strong nationalist movements that have been historically opposed to intervention from the central government. “The daily feedback is extraordinary. We go wherever we are wanted.” Each of these military units working across Spain – 8,000 soldiers a day, including 3,000 military health professionals some of whom have come out of retirement – is signaled on the huge electronic map covering a wall at the Joint Operations Center (JOC) at the Retamares base, west of Madrid. Today 400 missions are underway. This is the nerve center of Operation Balmis – the Armed Forces mission to combat the coronavirus crisis. The JOC looks like a cinema with the lights dimmed. At the front of the room are screens showing data that is continuously updated. Close by, officers from the three different armed forces are on computers. They are experts in operations, logistics and intelligence. At the top of the amphitheater, three generals and a naval captain receive all the information they need to make decisions. There are also members of the Civil Guard, the National Police, Civil Protection and the Military Emergency Unit, as well as liaison officers who are in contact with Spain’s Health, Defense, Interior and Mobility ministries, all of which are managing the crisis. “This is pure coordination,” explains a naval officer. “We are like mailboxes; we have information about what is needed everywhere in Spain at any given time and we know which military unit can do it because of their proximity and competence. And we cross reference this data. Every unit knows 24 hours in advance what it has to do the next day.” Currently, 12-hour shifts are the order of the day here, but the JOC is active 365 days of the year. Spain’s air, sea and land space is also controlled from this room, as well as its military operations abroad, in which 3,000 Spanish soldiers are currently participating – some of whom have also been infected. A handful of electronic clocks mark the time zone of every place that Spanish military personnel have been deployed, whether they are in transit or in Lebanon or Iraq. At 8am, the “operations update” takes place in this room with mathematical precision, during which the shift supervisor who is about to go off duty explains the current state of play to the officer relieving him and to the lieutenant general, Fernando López del Pozo, who is in charge of executing Operation Balmis. A specialist in emergencies, López del Pozo struggles to arrange his mask, which he is careful to keep over his nose. All the JOC officers wear one, as well as latex gloves. And they maintain a safe distance from one another. A lieutenant colonel continually warns the journalist not to go near him. “Neither of us can get sick,” he says. The JOC was activated by Defense Minister Margarita Robles on March 13, when the royal decree implementing a state of alarm, aimed at slowing the coronavirus outbreak, was published. “Early on Saturday, March 14, we had a meeting of the Planning Group to set the whole operation up,” explains Colonel Juan Bustamante. “That meeting produced an operations plan – a brief dossier that considered the needs of the ministries of Health, Defense, Interior and Mobility, and how we could support them. At the end of the meeting, a naval captain suggested naming the operation ‘Balmis’ – the name of a military doctor [Francisco Javier de Balmis] who organized an around-the-world expedition to distribute the smallpox vaccine in the early 19th century. It fit. This is a military mission to support the civilian population. Pure crisis management. In just 48 hours – by Monday, March 16 – we were on the streets, with Madrid as a priority, and the soldiers patrolling the subway and train stations.” But it wasn’t entirely unknown territory. “We pay a lot of attention to detail,” explains one officer from the Operations Command. “The military has a strategy for everything.” This command center, from which a war involving Spain would be directed, has the advantage of having a permanent structure with which to conduct operations as well as the technical support from around 20 contingency plans, drawn up by 100 full-time analysts, which are updated every year. These plans contemplate a variety of potential risks to state security, from high-intensity conflicts to terrorist threats and natural disasters. And when any of those contingencies arise, the corresponding sealed envelope is opened and the response activated. Pandemics and epidemics were included in the 2017 National Security Strategy under the Mariano Rajoy administration. Lieutenant General López del Pozo explains that the situation was being considered in the light of the 2014 Ebola epidemic. That epidemic caused only one death in Spain, but 12,000 in Africa, and it continues to hang like the sword of Damocles over humanity – though not in the same way as the coronavirus. “This [the coronavirus crisis] is exceptional. But we are responding to it every day and helping the most disadvantaged groups,” says López del Pozo. “Come on, Maria, finish your milk and your muffin,” says a nurse to an 80-year-old eating breakfast in her room at the Alcalá de Henares residence where the paratroopers are waiting to disinfect. “The police are going to come and help us.” The senior care facility is a home of smaller homes, with each room holding the treasured memories of the resident as well as their most prized possessions. There are old black and white photos, framed fans, children’s drawings and religious prints. On the sink stands the perfume gifted by the grandchildren at Christmas. One of the rooms looks like a small palace with silver candlesticks and a red velvet armchair, and another looks like the cell of a Carthusian monastery. The resident of this one doesn’t want to go out in the hall. He needs convincing. The care workers at the residence have lifted the mattresses, opened the wardrobes and bathrooms and removed the curtains and carpets. The residents are confined to the dining room on each floor and sit there with their masks on, on separated chairs. All look confused and some look panic-stricken. Most are sad. After a while, they appear to become lost in their own thoughts. One woman, who has been watching the decontamination process through the glass, suddenly claps her hands and cries, “Long live Spain!” Second lieutenant Carlos Infante puts out his cigarette and moves his unit into action. They are provided with freshly opened NBC equipment – camouflage uniforms made of a technical and leathery fabric that hermetically covers their face, head and body, and fastens at the wrists and ankles with duct tape. They wear thick rubber gloves and rubber shoes that make them walk like ducks. Over their faces are black M6-87 masks with carbon filters that protect against bacteriological, chemical and radioactive contamination. They can drink without removing this from a flask that looks like an anteater’s snout. When they put the mask on, it fogs up and their breathing becomes labored. Any physical effort is four times as hard. The effect is similar to a feeling of drowning. Communicating with gestures alone, the paratroopers climb the stairs to all four floors of the residence. The NBC operational procedure means disinfecting from the top floor down, without going near the “hot spot” where the sick have been isolated. Before entering the building, the soldiers themselves have been thoroughly disinfected to ensure that no germs enter or leave the residence. Whenever they take a break, they have to repeat this process, which entails being sprayed with cold water and bleach – sodium hypochlorite – washing shoes, gloves and finally hands and face. The mask comes off and for a few minutes they can breathe easily. Then they go back inside. “Here, even if you go out to pee, you have to disinfect yourself again,” one soldier jokes. Decontaminating the residence is a slow and systematic business. Soldiers spray bleach on the ceilings and walls. Then another team of paratroopers arrives, spraying ten-liter bags filled with bleach into every nook and cranny, dousing the beds, wardrobes and bathrooms. Then comes the “Commando Wipe” team that cleans each doorknob, mirror, door, table and handrail with a cloth. Finally, there is the mop brigade that deals with the floors. Room by room, corridor by corridor, bathroom by bathroom. When it’s all done, the residence is dried and ventilated. “We have been given this mission and I treat it as if it were a high-intensity conflict, like a war against the virus,” says one exhausted soldier. The armed forces’ work under Operation Balmis is fast, flexible and modular. And it is going on everywhere in Spain. On the one hand, the military are offering the civilian authorities tangible support and on the other, they are shoring up confidence and helping the public feel more secure. When French President Emmanuel Macron launched a similar military mission against the coronavirus called Resilience, French president, he made it clear that it was quite different from Operation Sentinelle, which is designed to combat Islamist terrorism within the country. “Resilience will be focused on supporting citizens and public services in a continuous dialogue with the state authorities,” he said. And that is the key – being at the service of the authorities; making the population feel safe. When Lieutenant Ezequiel’s unit patrols the deserted streets of El Escorial some 50 kilometers northwest of Madrid, and the footsteps of around 30 soldiers from the Guadarrama brigade reverberate across the cobblestones of the monastery, their role is clear. They don’t carry rifles and only the officers are armed. From the windows the residents smile down at them. Captain Diego Ruiz responds with a salute and the residents break into applause. What is the point of these patrols? According to the royal decree officially declaring the state of alarm, these soldiers are “agents of authority.” “This does not mean that they can make arrests or file complaints, because they are not judicial police,” explains López del Pozo. Consequently, some patrols have joined forces with members of the National Police and the Civil Guard, which is a way of using 120,000 Spanish soldiers to help with public security, under the orders of the state security forces and the Interior Ministry. “The prime minister [Pedro Sánchez] has looked in the state’s toolbox and has seen that the military is ideal in a moment of national crisis when the security and well-being of citizens is threatened because we can do everything – we reach everywhere, we are disciplined, we have a capillary structure, logistical means and we are not afraid. We have a complete catalogue of abilities and are very clear on how far we can go,” explains a senior military official. Captain Francisco José González has just set up a field hospital with 130 beds in Segovia, northwest of Madrid, with the Salamanca Engineer Command, which is specialized in setting up military camps. He is now setting up another field hospital in Madrid, outside the Gregorio Marañón hospital, which has been overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Next, the unit will be in the Catalan city of Sabadell to set up an emergency hospital in the city’s sport center. The interior of the enormous Drash tents, set up in just minutes outside the Gregorio Marañón hospital, is bright, comfortable, clean and even warm. They are a perfect backup for the hospital’s emergency department, but not as a permanent ward for coronavirus victims. Two generators installed by Captain González’s soldiers provide the field hospital’s power – there is air conditioning and toilets. A brief chat with these military engineers reveals that they are young and highly motivated people. “We are happy to lend a hand wherever we are needed,” says one. On the other side of Madrid, a non-commissioned army officer has been entrusted with a more taxing job – that of transporting corpses to the temporary morgue that has been set up in Madrid’s Ice Palace skating rink. Without missing a beat, he explains the task: first strict triple identification protocol of the bodies, then the sealing of the body bags with a zipper, followed by the sealing of the coffins. “The key is not to break the chain of care at any time; to get rid of any doubts. This is the job we have been called on to do. Yesterday we moved almost 100 [bodies]. It’s another way of serving Spain, one we could never have imagined. This is the war of our generation.” English version by Heather Galloway. ",['Jesús Rodríguez']
2020-06-18, 06:34 UTC,An analysis of three Covid-19 outbreaks: how they happened and how they can be avoided,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-06-17/an-analysis-of-three-covid-19-outbreaks-how-they-happened-and-how-they-can-be-avoided.html,"A crowded restaurant to celebrate the Chinese New Year; 100 workers infected inside a 19-story building; a group of devout Buddhists travelling by bus for a religious ceremony. These were the scenarios for three outbreaks of Covid-19 that have been carefully documented by the authorities. What happened in each one? What were the risk factors? What lessons can be learned, now that we are trying to get back to normal and return to restaurants, offices and other shared spaces? In a single wing of a call center in Seoul, in South Korea, the risk of infection was multiplied by four key factors: close, prolonged contact between numerous people, in an enclosed space.  Research carried out by local authorities revealed that almost all the people infected in a 19-story building with more than a thousand residents and office workers were confined to this area. Moreover, those infected were almost exclusively working in the same room. Despite the considerable interaction between workers from different floors of the building in the elevators and the lobby, the spread of the virus was largely confined to that one space filled with employees sitting at desks, “indicating that the duration of the interaction (or contact) was probably the main facilitator for extensive infection,” according to the Seoul authorities’ report. Recommendations from scientists and health experts aim to diminish the risk by avoiding large concentrations of people with measures ranging from taking turns to remote work to using physical protection such as masks and preventing employees from sharing office materials. The recommendations also include physically distancing staff by cutting out big meetings and keeping numbers low at access points and in food and drink zones; spaces should also be properly ventilated. “We must reduce the concentration of people and exposure time, the time they spend together,” says Maricruz Minguillón, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council’s Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Studies (IDAEA-CSIC). “If we reduce both factors, we reduce the risk.” How it can be avoided Natural ventilation to avoid the recirculation of infected particles Avoid concentrations of employees either in meetings or in food and drink zones 2 m.

No sharing of material or equipment between co-workers without prior disinfection A New Year’s meal in the Chinese city of Guangzhou on January 24 provides the best example of how to reduce indoor risks. This scenario has been analyzed in detail in two different studies (1, 2) by the Chinese health authorities, who concluded that poor ventilation can be a decisive risk factor if contact is maintained during prolonged periods. Again, time plus social proximity multiplies the risks.  Cameras on the premises show that those infected had no contact in the washrooms or elsewhere that could have led to the transmission of the virus. Although close contact can play an important role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, transmission of the virus in small airborne droplets “in crowded, poorly ventilated rooms” is also possible, according to the scientists. Outdoor air vents in the restaurant were closed. “Our study suggests that it is vital to prevent overcrowding and provide good ventilation in buildings and public transportation to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2,” they add. The recommendations from the health authorities invariably insist on avoiding recirculating air, as well as holding activities outside whenever possible. How it can be avoided Avoid background music so people don’t have to raise their voices and expel more droplets as they speak Open windows even if it makes people feel uncomfortably warm or cold Avoid the recirculation of air 2 or 3 m Reduce the size of indoor gatherings Whenever possible, hold the event outdoors Increase the distance between people How it can be avoided Avoid background music so people don’t have to raise their voices and expel more droplets as they speak Open windows even if it makes people feel uncomfortably warm or cold Avoid the recirculation of air 2 or 3 m Reduce the size of indoor gatherings Whenever possible, hold the event outdoors Increase the distance between people How it can be avoided Open windows even if it makes people feel uncomfortably warm or cold Avoid background music so people don’t have to raise their voices and expel more droplets as they speak Avoid the recirculation of air Always use air filters Reduce the size of indoor gatherings 2 or 3 m Increase the distance between people Whenever possible, hold the event outdoors How it can be avoided Open windows even if it makes people feel uncomfortably warm or cold Avoid background music so people don’t have to raise their voices and expel more droplets as they speak Avoid the recirculation of air Always use air filters Reduce the size of indoor gatherings 2 or 3 m Increase the distance between people Whenever possible, hold the event outdoors Chinese authorities and researchers from US universities are analyzing an outbreak at a Buddhist ceremony that was attended by people travelling on two buses for a total of 100 minutes – 50 minutes each way. A woman with symptoms was traveling on one of the vehicles, where the air was recirculated; 23 passengers were infected. “Patient 0 in this outbreak appears to have been a superspreader,” explains Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. “As at the restaurant, transmission could be explained by aerosols and droplets traveling longer distances due to the draft from the window or the air conditioning,” she adds.  A number of studies in Japan and elsewhere show that public transportation is not responsible for multiple infections as long as users maintain the rules of hygiene and protection, especially the use of masks that prevent infected individuals from releasing contagious droplets into the atmosphere, as happened with patient 0 on the coach. It is also suggested that specific protection measures be introduced for drivers of public transportation, as well as improving ventilation and increasing the regularity of coaches and trains in order to reduce crowding. How it can be avoided In any setting in which people are together for a prolonged period, these measures should be taken, prioritizing those that are most effective at protecting us from the risk of infection. + Physical distance •Teleworking • Reducing number    of employees in offices Effectiveness Engineering control • Creating physical barriers    between people – Administrative control Protection • Redistributing    responsibilities    to reduce contact    between people • Mandatory use    of non-medical    masks How it can be avoided In any setting in which people are together for a prolonged period, these measures should be taken, prioritizing those that are most effective at protecting us from the risk of infection. + Physical distance •Teleworking • Reducing number    of employees in offices Effectiveness Engineering control • Creating physical barriers    between people – Administrative control Protection • Redistributing    responsibilities    to reduce contact    between people • Mandatory use    of non-medical    masks How it can be avoided In any setting in which people are together for a prolonged period, these measures should be taken, prioritizing those that are most effective at protecting us from the risk of infection. •Teleworking • Reducing number    of employees in offices + Physical distance Effectiveness • Creating physical barriers    between people Engineering control • Redistributing responsibilities    to reduce contact between people Administrative control • Mandatory use    of non-medical masks – Protection How it can be avoided In any setting in which people are together for a prolonged period, these measures should be taken, prioritizing those that are most effective at protecting us from the risk of infection. •Teleworking • Reducing number    of employees in offices + Physical distance Effectiveness • Creating physical barriers    between people Engineering control • Redistributing responsibilities    to reduce contact between people Administrative control • Mandatory use    of non-medical masks – Protection Effectiveness Sources: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Guangzhou and Hangzhou, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the Spanish National Research Council’s Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Studies (IDAEA-CSIC), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, International Laboratory for Air Quality & Health (WHO, Queensland), and the government of South Korea.

2020-07-31, 14:45 UTC,"The real Covid-19 death toll in Spain: at least 44,868 victims",society,/society/2020-07-31/the-real-covid-19-death-toll-in-spain-at-least-44868.html,"Covid-19, which is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in November 2019, has killed at least 44,868 people in Spain since February 13, when the first death from the disease was recorded. That is much higher than the official death toll of 28,432 reported by the Spanish Health Ministry based on cases that were tested and came back positive. To arrive at this figure, EL PAÍS has included all the people who died either from confirmed or suspected Covid-19, using records from the 17 autonomous regions of Spain as well as excess death studies by two state-funded agencies and a trade association. The figure, which makes Spain’s death toll second only to the UK’s in Europe, includes 16,436 additional deaths to those recorded by the Health Ministry, which currently still counts only people who test positive for the virus. The higher number of 44,868 is closer to the figures in studies carried out by the Carlos III Institute of Health (44,418), the National Statistics Institute (44,395) and the Spanish Association of Funeral Professionals and Services (43,985). As part of the Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Carlos III Health Institute monitors the mortality rate daily with data provided by 3,800 civil registries. This monitoring is part of a year-round alert system that will flag up any circumstance relevant to public health, such as a heatwave or a pandemic. As a benchmark for its analyses, the institute uses the average number of deaths in the last 10 years and compares that figure with the current situation. The results for the period between March 14, when Spain entered a state of alarm, to May 22, when hospital deaths began to fall dramatically, show that deaths were up by 44,118 on the previous 10 year-average. Meanwhile, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which is part of the Ministry of Economy, has launched a pilot study that shows an excess of 44,395 deaths between January 1 and May 24 of this year compared to the same period last year. The role of Covid-19 in this vertiginous rise becomes even more dramatic after observing that until March 14, there were almost 3,000 fewer deaths in Spain compared to the same period in 2019, according to INE data. Both the INE and the Carlos III Institute of Health base their studies on data provided by the Directorate General of Registries, which answers to the Justice Ministry, via the Inforeg service, which includes data from 3,800 civil registries across Spain, covering 93.4% of the population. The INE explains that, unlike the Carlos III Health Institute, its own data covers 100% of the population due to the application of a higher coefficient to the deaths recorded in Inforeg to compensate for data on the missing 6.4%. The coefficient is calculated on the basis of a historical comparison between Inforeg data and the number of deaths finally recorded by INE, which is invariably higher. Although no expert doubts that the excess mortality recorded by the two public bodies is mainly attributable to Covid-19, the Carlos III Institute stresses that it will be impossible to confirm whether all the deaths were due to the pandemic until the cause of death that appears in the medical certificates becomes available. The difference between the data recorded by the 17 autonomous regions and the data from the Health Ministry is most glaring in the four most severely affected regions – Madrid, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Castilla y León – which account for 75% of mortality from Covid-19. Thousands of deaths recorded in these regions occurred in nursing homes and, to a lesser extent, at home. The public health services in these regions believe that, in the vast majority of cases, Covid-19 was responsible, though the victims were never tested. During the first month of the epidemic, between March 14 and April 14, hospitals were overwhelmed by the numbers being admitted, which led all too often to the neglect of the sick in nursing homes. This alone complicates estimates of actual mortality from the pandemic. The Ministry of Health argued from the outset that its death count followed World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, which stipulated that only those who tested positive should be recorded as Covid deaths. But on June 6, the WHO changed its criteria to include those who are strongly suspected to be Covid-19 victims. Fernando Simón, director of Spain’s Center for the Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies, said more than a month ago that the Health Ministry should adjust the death count according to the new WHO criteria, although he did not specify when this would be done. “This puts us in a situation where every country is going to have to make adjustments to their data at some point so that we can compare it,” he said. France, however, began to officially record those who died in nursing homes and residences on April 6, boosting the number of deaths on one single day by 1,000. The UK did likewise on April 29 and increased its total death count by 4,000. On June 1 and 2, Fernando Simón said that no Covid-19 deaths had been recorded for the first time since the beginning of the health crisis, according to the health statistics itemized as “Deaths reported in the last seven days.” However on June 1, seven regional governments reported 24 deaths in their hospitals; and on June 2, nine regions confirmed 34 further deaths from the virus. The Health Ministry added these figures to its lists of deaths many days later. On June 2, the ministry stated that Madrid had not reported any deaths occurring in the last seven days. But, in fact, the Madrid region had reported 80 deaths in that period. Over the last week, the ministry has reported two deaths in Catalonia while the regional government’s department of health has reported 32 deaths in its hospitals in the same period. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Catalonia has generated data that does not coincide with that of the Health Ministry. According to officials in charge of the region’s data, the ministry asks for certain data published daily by the region and interprets it, but “only the Catalan government knows Catalonia’s epidemiological reality.” This epidemiological reality has resulted in some impossible figures. On May 18, the Catalan health department counted 6,614 deaths in hospitals due to Covid-19. A day later, the number had fallen to 6,385 deaths. On May 23, Catalonia added 18 deaths, but the Health Ministry only noted seven, with the following explanation: “Catalonia has reported more deaths from previous days that are pending assignment by date of demise. The series is being reviewed.” As recently as July 23, Catalonia had still recorded nine deaths for that day in May. However, when the number of deaths was counted according to location, it appeared that 13 more people had died that day in the region’s hospitals. English version by Heather Galloway.

2020-06-24, 06:30 UTC,The problems Spain’s outdated data methods have caused during a 21st-century pandemic,society,/society/2020-06-24/the-problems-spains-outdated-data-methods-have-caused-during-a-21st-century-pandemic.html,"On March 18, a Spanish man appeared on a database of people infected by the coronavirus: it was patient 217, a 22-year-old student who had been hospitalized in Singapore. Singapore was providing these and other details as part of their case-by-case data strategy, while in Spain, total numbers according to age had yet to be published. The story appeared in EL PAÍS and three days later, patient 217 himself contacted the newspaper via a social network: “Hello, I am the Spaniard who tested positive for the coronavirus on his return from Spain to Singapore,” he said. The incident illustrates the disparities in the use of cutting-edge technology. The management of information in some Asian countries has been an example of modernity – for better or worse – while Spain and some of its neighbors are still languishing in the last century. “The management of information and statistical data have been a big problem during this pandemic in Spain and in Europe,” says Helena Legido-Quigley, an expert in health services and associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Clara Prats, a researcher in computational biology at Catalonia’s Polytechnic University (UPC), agrees. “All European countries have had to deal with similar problems, some more serious than others,” she says, adding that Spain lacked information systems that could cope. “They had to be corrected, validated and optimized as they went along.” Meanwhile, Ángela Bernardo, a science journalist at Civio – an organization that promotes transparency in public entities – believes that “information management and communication has been revealed as a weakness,” and Saúl Ares, from the Spanish National Research Council’s (CSIC) National Biotechnology Centre, says “it has been a disaster.” One obvious lesson that can be drawn from this crisis is that the capacity to manage medical data must be improved for the sake of transparency but, above all, because having organized and detailed data helps fight epidemics. Epidemiologists don’t even know where to start when asked about the importance of the data. “The quantitative is inherent in epidemiology,” explains Miquel Porta, researcher and professor of Public Health at the Hospital del Mar Institute in Barcelona. Epidemiology emerged as a discipline after the 19th-century English physician, John Snow, used maps and statistics to prove that cholera outbreaks were caused by contaminated water. “Epidemiologists are the original data scientists,” says Miguel Hernán, professor of Epidemiology at Harvard. The significance of data was highlighted in February this year when the figures coming in from China triggered concern among experts. “The epidemiological elite started talking about the possibility of a pandemic at the beginning of the month,” says Hernán. “By February 25, there was already a certain consensus among them.” It was the data on the rate of infection, the lethality of the virus, the infectious capacity of people who were asymptomatic, the number of exported cases and signs of transmission outside of Wuhan that led to this conclusion. On February 14, Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch was interviewed several times, stating that a global pandemic was likely. “They were telling us in January that there was a 50% chance, then at the beginning of February – 70%, and at the end of that month – 99%,” Hernán explains. “It is a new highly contagious pathogen, which can spread rapidly and should be considered capable of causing a huge social, economic and health impact anywhere. It is not SARS and it is not flu.” As early as March, the figures suggested a consistently dismal outlook. The Johns Hopkins University website was anticipating which problems would emerge country by country, and those states where cases were flagged up subsequently saw massive outbreaks. Since then, the data has proved vital in pinpointing potential outbreaks, tracking contacts and locating clusters. It is data that has provided the information needed to allow us to protect ourselves. For example, we know to avoid poorly ventilated, enclosed spaces because a number of countries have collected the necessary data, investigating one office desk by desk. Below is a review of the problems experienced in Spain in terms of data management, many of which are shared with other countries. Early detection failed in February in Spain. The problem was due to the limited scope of the detection protocol. Until February 25, the only people allowed to be tested for Covid-19 were those coming from Wuhan. That made it impossible to detect local infections that were already on the rise. By the end of the month, when this protocol was relaxed, people testing positive surfaced so fast that epidemiological surveillance systems were overwhelmed. The clearest example of this is SiVies, the National Center for Epidemiology’s (CNE) computer platform, which received information on each individual case from each autonomous region, including the patient’s age, place of residence, symptoms, and so on. This system was seen to be far from adequate. On March 9, only 140 cases out of almost 1,000 known cases in Spain (14%) had been reported and on March 16, only 700 out of 10,000 cases had found their way onto the database (8%). Public health services in the regions were passing on data very late. At the end of March, according to information from fact-checking and verification website Maldita.es, three regions had failed to notify SiVies of even 20% of their known cases (Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia) and one of the hardest-hit regions had not yet reported a single case (Castilla-La Mancha). The services that were supposed to monitor and control the epidemic were overwhelmed. They lacked qualified personnel, and were also technologically outdated. “The public health service is terrible when it comes to IT systems,” says Miquel Porta. “They are completely disparate, weak and often incompatible. The ministry does not exercise the necessary leadership in epidemiological surveillance systems.” Hernán believes this is the main reason why so many European countries have been slow to react compared to Asian countries: “They already had both the public health infrastructure and public awareness there to defend themselves against the virus,” he says. Another task that depended on the public health system was contact tracing. But if they didn’t even have the time to record cases in SiVies, how were they going to locate and interview the people connected to those cases? They needed an army, one that still hasn’t arrived – “One technician for every 3,000 people,” explains Legido-Quigley. That would mean 15,000 trackers working across Spain, which, according to the ministry, now has just 1,554 people doing the job. Then there’s the information systems. “There has been a huge effort to collect the data,” says Legido-Quigley. “But it is complicated with 17 autonomous regions and with the scant investment that has been devoted to developing monitoring systems over the years.” Experts highlight the effort made by public health professionals, but Hernán’s conclusion seems to be widespread among them – that the consolidation of systems capable of dealing with the task at hand will require greater investment in terms of both money and personnel. The Coordination Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES), led by Fernando Simón, has centralized the data provided by the Health Ministry on infections, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths. But for months its management has appeared amateurish. Every day, figures from each region were recorded and summarized in a daily report – a handful of sheets of paper – in a PDF. The system was set up on the fly. Existing information systems were not integrated, and on March 15, the ministry requested that the regions report their data between 8 and 9pm, using a dozen general indicators. The request was rectified a month later in a bid for clarification. For weeks, the data on hospitalized and ICU patients had been added up differently, depending on the region. Madrid, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Galicia reported the people admitted daily, while the rest gave the total admissions to date. The confusion was not detected until April 2 and was not corrected until the end of that month. These problems were acknowledged by Science Minister Pedro Duque, in an interview with EL PAÍS on April 23. “We didn’t have a roadmap for the pandemic,” he said. “Now we know; what we have to do is get a lot more people to collect data and compile it centrally. The data generated in a hospital goes first to a [local] department, then to the central government. These data have been slow in reaching us.” The information received and disclosed by the CCAES gave an overview of all the cases in a region. It was not until May 12 that the ministry requested individualized information. Since then, it has required public health departments to report details on a case-by-case basis through SiViEs, “to facilitate early detection.” It is not clear when this information began to be channeled to the Health Ministry, but it started to be published at the end of May after the problematic transition. The change to individual data was potentially positive, but the transition has been a disaster and not even the Health Ministry has been able to adapt. Its “Covid-19 Situation” panel stopped updating on May 21 and didn’t start again until June 10. Meanwhile, figures of the hospitalized and deceased have not yet been recovered. The hiatus has left many researchers without a clear picture. “We stopped publishing the daily report on the regions during those weeks,” explains Clara Prats. “We are also being affected by the freezing of the series of Covid-19 deaths, since we cannot carry out any analysis of real case estimates.” Similarly, Susanna Manrubia, a researcher at the National Centre for Biotechnology (CSIC), says: “The data arrived late, and then we discovered that they were also unreliable. The change in criteria over the last month and a half, and the disappearance of around 2,000 deaths, is the tip of the iceberg.” The other major setback came with data on the deceased. For weeks, the daily report has disclosed an inaccurate toll. On May 27, there was a column called “total deaths” but it was not the real total. A footnote explained that only cases whose date of death was recorded as the previous day were added up daily. This did not make sense as deaths take several days to be recorded. Consequently, the real figure was being permanently underestimated. A death that took place the day before yesterday and was known today would not be added to the total. Fernando Simón himself confirmed this was the case. EL PAÍS wrote several reports about the confusion. Shortly afterwards, The Financial Times dedicated an article to Spain’s “flawed data,” and finally the problems became widely recognized. The week of May 27 to June 3, for example, the “total” increased by only 10 deaths, although the same report said that the ministry was aware of 63 deaths in the last seven days. The unreliable “total” has resulted in chaos. Around June 3, there were days when no deaths were recorded, although the weekly figure still showed at least five or six a day and we now know that there were at least 20. It was a mistake to call something “total” that was not. And it was misleading to only record the deaths from the day before, if 90% of deaths take longer to make their way through the system. Fernando Simón acknowledged these problems, but the confusion was evident and even the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, ended up claiming a zero death toll when it wasn’t so. The debate has escalated, despite the fact that the truth is obvious: the government has not hidden the number of deaths, but neither has there been clear communication. It is not a case of the government hiding the figures because, if we know that there are more than 40,000 or 50,000 deaths recorded on the civil registers, it is precisely because that information is now published by the National Statistics Institute (INE). At the same time, the figures have clearly been contradictory. Firstly, because the wrong total was published during two weeks of a tricky transition. Secondly, because the official figure of confirmed deaths from Covid-19 was frozen at around 27,000 for more than three weeks. And thirdly, because the daily report could have provided more data to avoid clouding the issue. It is true that confirmed deaths are a standard measure used by many countries, but there was nothing to stop the ministry’s reports from also publishing the deaths being recorded over and above those figures. There are a number of key data on which decisions have been based and which have not been modified. For example, during the confinement, infections continued to occur, but their whereabouts were unclear. A more effective system would have targeted specific neighborhoods and residences, as in New Zealand, where outbreaks were reported in an old people's home in Auckland and a wedding in Bluff. Only a few regions in Spain provided this kind of detailed information. There are also doubts concerning the information on which the de-escalation is based. The April 28 strategy announced that the move from one phase to another would be based on objective criteria and public indicators according to province. A comprehensive list of indicators was drawn up which were to be ticked off “in an automated, daily and individualized manner.” But the list was never published. Some of these indicators were among those requested by the ministry from the public health departments on May 12, but they have only been partially published, and only since the end of May, which is after the May 8 and May 15 phase changes were decided. Another unknown has been the extent and success of tracking in each autonomous region. It was supposed to be fundamental to preventing outbreaks, but no information was published until the start of June; the number of trackers was unknown as was the number of contacts identified as infected or positive. Figures on tracking were published only after June 5, without any breakdown by region. The Health Ministry has offered very little clear data on the coronavirus. There are some exceptions, such as a number of series published in CSV format through the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII), but these have been rare and irregularly updated as the focus of communication has been on the PDF reports. The difference between the CSV and the PDF may seem like a technicality, but the CSV is accepted good practice everywhere. Transparency requires communicating data in a systematic way and in formats that can be reused and scrutinized. Without this, analysis becomes complicated, as Saúl Ares, a researcher at the CSIC, explains. “It is not only about the changes in criteria or the series that are discontinued,” he says. “It is about the fact that, until now, after fishing around to find some slightly less common piece of data, you finally get to the PDF. Tables on a PDF! I guess some people will not realize how ridiculous this is.” Several organizations have asked for other data without success, such as the number of tests that were done in March. “For many weeks, the numbers of diagnostic tests carried out were not reported, even though this indicator is crucial to knowing how the epidemic is being managed,” says Ángela Bernardo. Even today, we do not know how many people are being tested and what percentage are positive – information that is being provided by countries such as Italy and the United States. In many places, there has been a lack of usable formats, although it is easy to find better practices on official websites in Iceland, Norway, Italy, the United Kingdom and some of Spain’s regions. Perhaps most seriously, access to the data is being restricted even among scientists. “From the beginning, we requested information according to municipality and age from the Carlos III Institute,” explains Manrubia. “We were told this was being reviewed and would soon be made public. But it hasn’t been yet. The lack of transparency in the data sounded like something was being hidden.” Meanwhile, Diego Ramiro, from the CSIC’s Institute of Economics, Geography and Demography describes a similar experience after having requested data from the Carlos III Institute without success: “They were not able to respond due to a lack of personnel,” he says, adding that there is a price to pay for the barriers preventing access to information being experienced by the academics. “We will likely have new outbreaks, as happened with the 1889 and 1918 flus; it would be convenient to analyze the behavior of Covid-19 before that happens,” he says. National information systems have proven to be inadequate. The CNE is trying to generate information for public health decision-making, but there have been long delays in data reaching them at key moments. The CCAES, whose function is to coordinate information management in health emergencies, has not always received the data automatically and it took months for it to request individualized information. There has been a lack of public health resources. The health services in each region have been quickly overwhelmed in the realms of monitoring and control tasks. There is a lack of personnel, especially in contact tracing, and the personnel there is may have had to fill in the gaps in the information systems manually. There may be a lack of professionals with quantitative profiles, such as data specialists. A culture of transparency is also needed. Some of the problems with management cannot be blamed on a lack of resources – publishing a CSV is as easy as publishing a PDF. Possibly what is needed is research – to conceptualize the ideal management of this crisis and then try to work out what prevented that from happening. Experts offer clues. “It is time to define protocols and facilitate their implementation,” says researcher Saúl Ares. “When faced with an epidemic, data collection must be exhaustive and transmitted to the authorities quickly and reliably; and it must be published immediately, transparently, centrally and in formats that allow for rational technological treatment.” The creation of new entities has also been suggested. Epidemiologist Miquel Porta believes that “there has to be a state-run public health agency, which works on systemic problems.” From the CSIC, Diego Ramiro suggests that a specialized agency similar to the INE should be set up for health statistics – “Focused on generating them and not on research, which would speed up the availability of data,” he says. Finally, it is worth asking whether the famous “data offices” – departments within the administration employing experts who know how to collect, analyze and disclose data – would have helped. For years, it has been said that data is the 21st century’s equivalent to gold, but we almost always think of the companies that exploit it. We forget that public institutions can make use of data to improve people’s lives. Fighting a pandemic is a case in point. English version by Heather Galloway.   ",['Kiko Llaneras']
2020-09-07, 06:30 UTC,Reconnecting with nature: five trails for forest immersion in Spain,spanish_news,/spanish_news/2020-09-07/reconnecting-with-nature-five-trails-for-forest-immersion-in-spain.html,"“This is not about tree hugging or walking barefoot through the leaves,” says Alex Gesse, the co-author along with Gorka Altuna of Forest bathing. 50 Routes to Feel Nature. Instead, what Gesse is advocating are walks in nature to improve mental health and general wellbeing while steering clear of any mystical undercurrents. “A forest bath is nothing more than a contemplative experience that connects us to the natural environment through our emotions and the five senses,” says Gesse, who is one of Europe’s most eminent experts in shinrin-yoku, which literally means “absorbing the atmosphere of the forest” in Japanese. Shinrin-yoku is a technique that Japan successfully incorporated into its public healthcare system in the 1980s to reduce the population’s high stress levels, taking advantage of the fact that three-quarters of its territory is covered by trees. “In a world where everything goes too fast, forest baths involve walking slowly, feeling the path, touching the trees, the water, hearing the birds sing, the wind howl, the dew drops fall,” explains Gesse in the foreword. Having grown up playing in the Mediterranean forests of the Empordà in Catalonia, Gesse has worked on issues related to nature and health for many years, but it was in 2016 that he founded the Instituto Baños de Bosque (or Forest Baths Institute) and three years later, together with Irish ecologist Shirley Gleeson, he created the Forest Therapy Institute, with the aim of ultimately incorporating these walks into Spain’s public healthcare system. Gesse believes that despite the fact that a growing number of city councils in Spain are including this type of initiative among their public services, Spanish doctors are still some way off giving patients what he terms “the green prescription,” something which “is already a trend in other countries around us, such as Scotland and more recently Germany, where the doctor can prescribe, in addition to medication, a therapy in the forest as a practical complement to treatment.” Based on his own experience of organizing hundreds of therapeutic walks and using what he learned from the teachings of Chinese immunologist Qing Li, the world’s foremost authority on forest medicine and father of the shinrin-yoku movement, Gesse believes that getting lost in nature strengthens the immune system, reduces stress and lowers blood pressure and heart rate. And he points out an important fact: “It doesn’t necessarily have to be in a forest; a city park next to your house will also do, or any green area that you particularly connect with.” “Forests already act as health infrastructures via the ecosystem services they provide such as filtering rain, purifying the air, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen,” adds his colleague Gorka Altuna. And it seems to be true that forest therapies aimed at certain disadvantaged groups have an almost immediate positive effect. “One of my first projects was with children at risk of social exclusion,” says Gesse. “At the end of the walks one of them told me, ‘The forest calms my bad thoughts.’” Equally positive results were obtained when forays into nature were organized for schizophrenia patients and victims of violence against women. It might seem obvious that a walk in the countryside needs no particular preparation, but many people require a helping hand to reconnect with nature in a “natural” way. The aim of a forest immersion is not to do physical exercise, and Gesse recommends that first-timers be accompanied by a qualified professional. He himself has instructed around 200 environmental educators who perform forest immersion and therapies in natural parks and green spaces in both Europe and the Americas. The task of these instructors is, above all, “to create a favorable environment in which the participants feel safe and comfortable, both physically and psychologically.” Forest bathing usually lasts less than two hours, takes place on little frequented trails, and is divided into three phases. The first leg of the journey is meant to “awaken the senses and get in harmony with the rhythms of nature.” The second involves multiple activities, from feeling the texture of a flower to sitting in silence to listen to the sound of the earth. The activities in the second leg vary according to the participants. As Gesse points out, “It is not the same to go for a walk with managers of multinationals who seek to strengthen creativity and communication as it is to go with a group of 80-year-old grandparents.” The last phase of the therapy includes a feedback session during which it is common to hear remarks such as “I have lost track of time,” or “I felt like a kid,” or “I am more relaxed than ever.” Ultimately, the aim is to be aware of having experienced something different before returning to the city. “There is no right or wrong way to communicate with the forest,” says Gesse. “Each person connects differently. You just have to let yourself go.” Many of the routes described in the book are frequented by hikers, but unlike a hike, “the important thing is not to arrive at a destination, but to enjoy the experience of living with the forest and its inhabitants, whatever their shape and size.” Gesse has chosen five of these 50 routes for EL PAIS’ travel section El Viajero. Each of them comes with information on organic compounds called monoterpenes that protect trees from predators and parasites as well as the ionization levels in the air on each stretch of the route. Scientific studies suggest that both these natural elements could have a direct beneficial effect on people’s immune systems. The natural park of Urkiola lies between the Basque provinces of Biscay and Álava and is home to an enormous range of fauna and flora. Covering an area of 5,958 hectares, the park encompasses three mountain ranges – the Aramotz-Eskubaratz, the Duranguesado and the Arangio. “Coming to Urkiola to enjoy a forest immersion means walking through the diverse landscapes that hide this spectacle of nature – green pastures, leafy and colorful forests and steep limestone peaks that shelter the valleys with their protective mantle,” says Johanna Maluenda, the creator of this route. The trail takes visitors through the Astxiki beech forest and the Guenzelai forest, which is home to ancient beech trees. Also in evidence are pine and birch trees, the latter giving Urkiola its name in Basque – the “land of birches.” The route is little more than a kilometer long but it offers participants the chance to enhance their sense of touch, “laying our hands on the greyish trunks of the beech trees and moving our fingers to experience their dampness and roughness.” There is also the opportunity to become aware of the firm but soft soil and “the cottony roots of the beech trees” under foot. The tour ends in the Guenzelai pastures “where you will feel the urge to sit on the soft and velvety grass that colors the entire place an intense green.” The Collado de Neila trail, which is a kilometer and a half long but reasonably easy, is located in the Lagunas Glaciares de Neila natural park, in the Demanda mountain range in Burgos province. The trail follows two streams and takes visitors into forests of wild pine mixed with beech, birch and holly trees. The creator of this route, Noemí Hortigüela, talks about pastures that are alive with the sound of cow bells. Along with horses, the cows graze in the same meadows that once welcomed shepherds returning from pastures further south in Extremadura at the start of each summer. According to Hortigüela, a spring excursion means enjoying the velvety texture and the aroma of wild rose petals while strolling among poplars, willows and ash trees. When the first beech trees appear, “we will be able to enjoy contemplating the komorebi, a Japanese word that means ‘the light of the sun filtering through the leaves of the trees.’ While many trees offer this possibility, the superimposed branches of the beech tree give it a special warmth.” Of the four great valleys that lie within Somiedo natural park, in Spain’s small northern Asturias region, the therapist Raquel de la Insúa chose Saliencia as the setting for her forest immersion among oaks, ashes, maples and lime trees. Besides being the wildest of the four valleys, Saliencia also has the largest number of teitos – traditional stone constructions with roofs made from broom branches, which were used to shelter people and livestock in days gone by and which now give the area the air of a medieval village. An instructor from the Forest Baths Institute, Insúa describes a simple 1.5-kilometer journey in which she was able to immerse herself in the beauty of this landscape. Humid and green all year round, the soft fresh breeze is ever present, caressing the face of the walker, whose view of the sky is obscured by the budding branches of beech trees in spring that turn red and gold in the fall, in Insúa’s own description. “Along its entire length, the Guadarrama River creates a natural riverside environment that, despite intense human activity, still has areas of great ecological value where you can find places to lose yourself and enjoy a unique environment,” says Paco García, an expert in forest immersion. Taking as a starting point the recreational area of the Retamar Bridge in the municipality of Las Rozas, northwest of the Spanish capital, García recommends a flat, circular route two kilometers long which brings visitors to a riverside forest in the process of recovery. The forest itself allows one to “admire how nature opens up a path across the scars of human activity in the area.” A grove of poplars and ash trees serves as a natural corridor for the fauna as well as for walkers. The route also passes through an area of herbs, “an ideal place to smell and explore not only the textures with our hands, but also the smells and how they impregnate our fingers.” Built during the reign of Philip II in the 16th century, the Retamar Bridge itself allows us to experience “the sensations generated by the temperature of the granite on our skin.” The sound of the River Guadarrama, “audible if the walker pays attention” provides a relaxing background sound while “its transparency most of the year and shallowness will perhaps allow us to see some fish and, with luck, some water birds,” says García. The forest of Les Estunes is very close to Lake Banyoles, the largest natural pond in Catalonia. Marta Ayats, the monitor in charge of this 850-meter-long route, recommends doing it on weekdays to avoid the crowds. The immersion for our senses starts with the view of a powerful oak tree, which acts as a gateway to a magical domain that has inspired legends about mythical creatures such as the goges, “the peculiar water nymphs that spent the night spinning near the lake to then take refuge in the large cracks in the travertine rock formed in previous geological eras and on top of which abundant vegetation and a forest of oaks has grown,” explains Ayats. Travertine is highly valued by sculptors and craftsmen and is formed by layers of lime deposited by the groundwater of the rivers Llierca and Borró. “Calmly, step by step, we breathe, stop from time to time and focus on the breeze that moves the leaves in the branches, the ivy that climbs to envelop trees 15 to 20 meters high, and the moss and ferns that share this humid habitat,” writes Ayats. “This space, as small as it is majestic, reflects how nature disinterestedly offers up its richness and diversity for our senses to enjoy and to make us feel part of it.” English version by Heather Galloway.

2020-08-31, 06:41 UTC,What to keep in mind if you are planning a vacation for September,el_viajero,/el_viajero/2020-08-31/what-to-keep-in-mind-if-you-are-planning-a-vacation-for-september.html,"The changing situation of the coronavirus health crisis in Spain and the rest of the world has led to great uncertainty about travel in September. Indeed, fear of the possible consequences of the pandemic, such as another lockdown or new quarantine measures, is the main reason why 40% of Spaniards think it is unlikely they will go on a vacation this year, according to a report from the Spanish National Tourism Observatory (ObservaTUR). Traveling under Spain’s “new normality” is very different, and certain precautions must be taken before a trip is booked. Here is a list of factors that must be considered when planning a holiday this fall. At the time of writing of this article, it is not currently possible to travel from Spain to all overseas destinations, given that the conditions of entry are constantly changing. Most countries have introduced restrictions on travelers from Spain, if they have not directly banned arrivals. Given that the epidemiological situation of the pandemic is different in every country, experts recommend consulting government websites of your planned destination to find out what measures have been set regarding visitors from Spain. Some countries have asked travelers to show that they have tested negative for Covid-19 two days before their flight, while others, such as the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland, have introduced mandatory quarantine measures for travelers from Spain. The online travel agency Rumbo has developed an algorithm that periodically creates a list of the safest countries to visit, based on the number of active Covid-19 cases, the state of the healthcare system and the distance to the destination country. Ahead of September, the countries highest rated by the algorithm were Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Germany, Portugal and Slovenia. Enrique García, the spokesperson of Spain’s Consumer and User Organization (OCU), has bad news on this front. “We would like to say that cancellation insurance is effective in these circumstances, but in practice, it only works when the consumer, for health reasons, cannot continue the journey.” He warns that, unless a person reads the small print on the contract and adjusts it to their situation, these “poorly named cancelation policies” will not cover the current contingencies caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It is advisable to book a trip with flexible cancellation policies (without added costs) for each service required, such as transportation, accommodation, activities and other services. But a traveler may receive a complete refund of these purchases for reasons of force majeure outside of their control. Keep in mind that if you book a trip abroad without meeting the current conditions of entry in that country, you lose your right to a refund or to any type of compensation. If a person cannot go on the holiday they have purchased due to new confinement measures, they have the right to ask for a refund. This could be for a complete refund because they have not gone on the vacation, or a partial one, if they have not been able to enjoy the entirety of the trip. The uncertainty in the tourism industry has led hotels to offer last-minute flash offers to ensure minimum occupation. Ana de la Fuente, the head of the sales team of the travel site Weekendesk’s Spain and Portugal offices, says that this year “clients are reserving with very little notice. Some 90% of our reservations are made for the same month they are in.” She adds that hotels are offering discounts of up to 35% for their September campaign on Weekendesk “because if not, many do not know if they will be able to open.” All transportation companies must, without exception, ensure that travelers wear a face mask for the duration of their trip. What’s more, given that in most cases safe distances cannot be guaranteed, there are very strict cleaning and disinfection protocols. Hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes are also handed out to all passengers. With respect to air conditioning, both buses and trains have been forced to program their systems so that there is greater recirculation of air. In other words, the units don’t recycle air from inside to save energy, but rather try to retain it for the shortest time possible to prevent air transmission of the virus. “There have been no outbreaks linked to means of transport,” adds Enrique García from the OCU. Yes. Despite what it might seem, the law does not differentiate between one type of tourist accommodation and another when it comes to coronavirus safety measures. All must comply with the same rules to reduce possible contagions, especially with respect to limits on capacity and disinfecting common areas. “We have seen that both hotels and camping sites are correctly maintaining all the security measures,” says Enrique García. “This year is a very special one, but the holidays of most Spaniards are similar to what they were last year, mainly in search of sun and beach,” says Alessia Dordonia, the head of communications of the travel site Lastminute.com. Despite this, the north of Spain, which typically has cooler weather, is seeing its best August in terms of tourism. The northern regions of Asturias and Cantabria, for example, have hotel occupancy levels at 95% and 93% respectively, while in Madrid the figure is below 30%. English version by Melissa Kitson.

2020-07-16, 08:36 UTC,The Three Amigos,the_global_observer,/the_global_observer/2020-07-16/the-three-amigos.html,"In 1986 Hollywood released the comedy The Three Amigos. It’s the story of three travelling comedians (Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short) who, dressed as Mexican cowboys, arrive in the town of Santo Poco to put on a show. Instead, they find a Mexican town besieged by a gang of bearded ruffians on horseback commanded by “El Guapo.” Naturally, the three friends (with the help of the beautiful and long-suffering Carmen) manage to free Santo Poco from El Guapo and his henchmen. The script for The Three Amigos indulges every cliché and stereotype that Americans have of Mexicans. In fact, El Guapo and his gang fit perfectly with Donald Trump’s description of Mexican immigrants: murderers, rapists, bad hombres. And, let’s not forget, animals. When Trump first began his anti-immigration rhetoric, and before Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) became president, the Mexican politician reacted indignantly: “Trump and his advisers speak of Mexicans the way Hitler and the Nazis referred to the Jews. We cannot consent to a state policy that undermines the dignity of the legitimate interests of Mexicans and the nation.” AMLO also denounced the wall that the US is building along the Mexican border as “a monument to hypocrisy and cruelty.” In contrast, Trump said “it’s beautiful” and added that “Mexico is not our friend.” That was then. Now, as President of Mexico, López Obrador recently visited the White House and, staring President Trump in the eye, acknowledged that: “We have received from you, President Trump, understanding and respect.” AMLO also said he appreciated the way Trump and his government treat Mexico and Mexicans. Trump was not far behind in his praise of Mexico, its president, and the millions of Mexican immigrants who work in his country. Grandiose, vacuous and clearly mendacious statements are business-as-usual in meetings between heads of state. In fact, the most interesting thing about the meeting between AMLO and Trump is not the falsehoods they said, but the truths they left unsaid. Perhaps the most important of these unmentionables is that they both preside over nations where Covid-19 is wreaking havoc. The United States is the world champion in terms of absolute number of infections, while the runner-up is Brazil, led by Jair Bolsonaro. But very close behind them, near the top of the tragic list, is Mexico. Unfortunately, it appears that the “remake” of The Three Amigos is going to be a tragedy rather than a farce. The three stars in the current version are at once very different and very similar. Their origins, careers, and ideologies could not be more different. But they are identical in terms of their narcissism, populism and irresponsibility. Initially, all three minimized the severity of the pandemic. All three were slow to react and spurned the recommendations of experts. Face masks and social distancing just aren’t their style. “With the coronavirus, there is this idea that you can’t hug,” the Mexican president said on TV. “You have to hug. Nothing happens. What protects us is not allowing corruption,” then he displayed several amulets and religious images that, according to him, are his “protective shield.” For their part, Trump and Bolsonaro (who is referred to by his followers as “the Trump of the Tropics”) also recommended the use of amulets. Theirs, however, are not religious but pharmaceutical. Trump was the first to recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat victims of Covid-19. In fact, he announced that he himself was testing the drug. The same with President Bolsonaro (who tested positive for the virus last week). Both ordered the purchase of massive quantities of this controversial drug whose healing properties have not been scientifically validated, despite the overwhelming evidence that it has dangerous side effects. And, of course, we cannot forget President Trump’s display of medical scholarship when, at a press conference, he speculated that taking bleach might be a good remedy for the virus, as well as bombarding it with ultraviolet rays. The three amigos share a deep-rooted disregard for science and experts. Another feature they share is a willingness to use the health emergency to deepen the divisions that fragment their respective societies. Who would have thought that the use of a mask could be transformed into a wedge issue? Well, the three amigos did. Certainly, some of the most iconic photos this pandemic will leave behind will be of these three presidents and their loyal followers defiantly exposing their faces without protective masks. These will be contrasted with the photos of people wearing their masks, thus illustrating a world divided between pro-mask and anti-mask groups. We can be sure that the approach of these maskless Covid-19 leaders is not sustainable and that the pandemic itself will eventually undermine the power that the three amigos wield today.

2020-06-30, 10:34 UTC,Four ideas damaged by Covid-19,the_global_observer,/the_global_observer/2020-06-30/four-ideas-damaged-by-covid-19.html,"Covid-19 kills not just people, it also kills ideas. And when it doesn’t kill them, it discredits them. For example, received ideas about office work, hospitals, and universities will not be the same when the dust settles from the pandemic. Nor will some of the more universal ideas about economics and politics. Here are four cases in point: 1. The United States is a source of global stability. False. The truth is that Washington has become an epicenter of geopolitical instability. The Bush administration’s response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example, sparked long and costly wars. In 2008, the US exported a serious financial crisis to the rest of the world. But no war or economic crisis has so eroded America’s influence in the world as the deeds of Donald Trump’s administration. Since his election in 2016, the president has shown, almost daily, that instead of calming the world and his country, he prefers to set off conflict and stir discord. America’s reaction to the pandemic has only confirmed that the White House is a volatile, accident-prone and unreliable ally. That the United States now radiates instability is particularly ironic because the greatest beneficiary of the international order that Trump is unraveling is the very nation that he presides. 2. International cooperation. The pandemic has also shown that the international community is incapable of coming together to respond effectively to global threats. The tragedies of Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and the Rohingyas are just some examples of the ineffectiveness of the international community. Covid-19 has demonstrated conclusively that a strong international community that works in coordination with its member nations does not exist. The response of most countries to this health emergency has not been to act jointly, but to entrench themselves behind their borders. The pandemic, for example, should have strengthened the World Health Organization (WHO), a flawed but indispensable multilateral entity. Instead, the White House – convinced that the WHO had been co-opted by the Chinese government – said it would withdraw from the organization. This came at the very moment that the Trump administration should have been leading an international coalition to support and reform the organization. Distrust of international cooperation has also contributed to ineffective coordination between countries with regards to safety standards as well as the production and distribution of medicines and medical supplies. And this is another irony: the rejection of international collaboration has led to an essentially local and inadequate response to a global threat. 3. Fiscal austerity. This idea, once the obligatory remedy for dealing with a financial crisis, is now toxic. Before, when faced with an economic crash, the government moved to severely restrict its spending and lower its indebtedness. Now it’s the opposite: spending more and increasing debt is the latest macroeconomic fashion. Everywhere you look, governments are increasing public spending to unprecedented levels. The fiscal deficit, which is the difference between tax collection and other government revenue and public spending, has shot up to levels that have never been seen before outside of war time. In the US, for example, this year’s fiscal deficit will reach a sum equivalent to 24% of the total output of the entire US economy. The indebtedness of almost all countries has also increased. Japan has the world’s largest debt relative to the size of its economy. But the United States is the world champion in absolute numbers: it owes $20 trillion (€117.8 trillion). In the coming years, deciding when and how these debts will be paid (and by whom!) will surely spark a fierce and furious global debate. 4. Globalization. This is another idea that was previously lionized and is now demonized. As is often the case, the idea wasn’t so great before, nor is it so bad now. For many, globalization is expressed in terms of the flow of products and money between countries. For others, its main and most worrying manifestation is immigration. In practice, globalization is much more complicated. It includes, of course, the enormous increase in the international flow of products, services, money and information. But it also includes the activities of terrorists, traffickers, criminals, scientists, artists, philanthropists, activists, athletes and non-governmental organizations. And, of course, it also includes the diseases that can now move at great speed across the globe. Governments can hinder some of these manifestations or stimulate others. What no one can do is completely end the multiple ways countries intertwine. The pandemic and its economic consequences will encourage the adoption of policies that cushion the external shocks that periodically shake countries. There will be more protectionism. But the advantages and attractions of some facets of globalization will not disappear. What do these discredited ideas have in common? All four are important pillars of the world order that emerged after World War II. Although all four pillars are damaged, it is possible to repair and improve them. This will be a major challenge in the years to come. @moisesnaim Poltics ",['Moisés Naím']
2020-06-16, 08:33 UTC,"Parking lots, coughing and the pandemic",the_global_observer,/the_global_observer/2020-06-16/parking-lots-coughing-and-the-pandemic.html,"What do cars in a parking lot have to do with online searches for terms like “diarrhea” and “cough”? And what do these data points tell us about the pandemic that is raging across the globe? As it turns out, a great deal. Researchers at Harvard Medical School have used satellite imagery to track the number of cars parked at six major hospitals in Wuhan, the city of 11 million inhabitants in central China where Covid-19 originated and then spread to the rest of the world. The Harvard scientists tracked the parking lot photos from January 2018 to April 2020. By analyzing the images, the researchers discovered an unusual increase in the number of cars parked between August and December 2019. In those months, the number of cars was above average and also higher than during flu outbreaks. But that is not all. In China, Google is blocked. The go-to search engine is called Baidu. In September and October, Baidu searches for the terms “cough,” “diarrhea” and “breathing problems” originating from Wuhan skyrocketed. The researchers came to a shocking conclusion: “Increased hospital traffic and symptom search data in Wuhan preceded the documented start of the pandemic in December 2019.” The conclusion is explosive because, according to the data, the outbreak began months before the Chinese government told the world what was happening, which wasted time other governments needed to prepare for the onset of pandemic. Not surprisingly, Beijing has denied this and questions the study’s validity. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their methodology and of the data they used. However, despite these limitations, it is obvious that the research provides a useful perspective. And not just about the pandemic. The Chernobyl effect. Bureaucracies tend to hide their mistakes and authoritarian bureaucracies even more so. Take the Soviet reaction to the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown in 1986. The disaster scattered radioactive material across the Soviet Union, parts of Europe, and even reached Canada. Everything indicates that the “Chernobyl effect” – the desperate scramble to conceal the problem in fear of political blowback – shaped the Chinese government’s response when it was clear that what was happening in Wuhan was serious, massive and unprecedented. The truth finds a way to come out. As hard as they tried, Soviet leaders couldn’t prevent the world from learning about Chernobyl. The same is true of China. First, there was a deliberate delay by the local government in Wuhan and then by the authorities in Beijing in acknowledging the magnitude of what was happening. It has always been difficult for governments to hide their secrets. Sooner or later the truth gets out. Today secrets are exposed faster than ever. Even the secrets of dictatorships. Everything can be measured. Who would have thought that counting the cars in a parking lot could reveal an incipient pandemic? Or that a spike in internet searches for certain words might forecast an epidemic? In these times, the mere fact that we exist as individuals generates a mountain of data that can be captured and processed – whether we like it or not. Mobile phones, cameras, computers, sensors and platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Flickr are ceaselessly collecting data about our behavior and transforming it into information that can be used – for good or bad. Everything is politicized. The Harvard study comes at a time of extreme tension between the United States and China. Trade, technology, finance, military superiority and geopolitical influence are just some of the arenas in which the two superpowers are facing off. Another important arena is international prestige. After the initial delay in recognizing and communicating the extent of the pandemic, Beijing has launched a broad propaganda campaign. It is emphasizing its success in containing the pandemic and contrasts it with the chaos-prone White House response. For its part, the United States government has launched a broad smear campaign against China, emphasizing the opacity of its approach and pinning responsibility for the crisis on Beijing. Attacks on China will certainly be a central theme of Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. China will undoubtedly respond. In a world without secrets, conflicts can be managed, but not suppressed. @moisesnaim ",['Moisés Naím']
2020-06-04, 11:22 UTC,What else is going on?,the_global_observer,/the_global_observer/2020-06-04/what-else-is-going-on.html,"The Covid-19 pandemic is clearly the most important threat affecting the world: it can make everything else feel minor by comparison. Yet important things are happening that may soon affect us all. Too many locusts. Locusts are one of the worst biblical plagues. Luckily, these plagues are rare. In the entire 20th century, there were only five outbreaks bad enough to devastate crops and leave famines in their wake. But at the end of last year, the largest outbreak in a quarter of a century began in one of the most isolated places in the world: the Rub al-Khali desert of Saudi Arabia. The insects in this swarm are younger than usual, fly faster, and can travel up to 200 kilometers a day. The swarm’s population multiplies by a factor of 20 every three months. In Kenya, a swarm of locusts three times the size of New York City – an estimated 192 billion insects – has wreaked havoc on crops. And it takes only one day for a regular-sized swarm to eat through enough crops to feed 35,000 people. The current locust crisis is also more international. It left the Arabian Peninsula to take aim at Africa. Now it is devastating crops in India and Pakistan. The cause? The cyclones that generate the humid conditions ideal for locust breeding. Cyclones used to occur very rarely in the areas where swarms originate, at most once per year. But in 2018 there were two cyclones and in 2019 there were eight. Experts say this is another manifestation of climate change. Too much oil. These days, not only are there too many locusts in the world, but there’s also too much oil. With many economies shut down, half the world’s formal sector workers at home, and transportation severely restricted, oil consumption has fallen dramatically. Amy Jaffe, an expert in energy policy, estimates that by the end of 2020 we’ll have an oil surplus of more than one billion barrels. That crude must be stored, and the world’s existing capacity of storage tanks and tanker ships is reaching its limit. As a result, oil is at its lowest price in 18 years. This massive oil glut will have enormous consequences for the future of energy. For example, it makes investing in energy much less attractive. The International Energy Agency has just reported the largest fall in investment in the industry’s history. Capital investments have decreased not only in coal, oil and gas, but also in renewables such as solar and wind. Lack of investment will eventually decrease the supply of energy, which will cause prices to rise. But until that happens, low prices will bankrupt the energy companies with high production costs or that are in a precarious financial situation. Additionally, countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela, whose economies depend almost exclusively on the export of oil and gas, will suffer from a debilitating economic crisis that could spark internal political turmoil or provoke international conflicts. Hong Kong is dead. Not because of the virus, but because of China’s leadership. The Chinese National People’s Congress passed a national security law that prohibit acts of “treason, secession, sedition and subversion” in Hong Kong. Now, Beijing can intervene in Hong Kong at will, repressing any activity it feels constitutes a threat and ignoring the elected authorities. Inevitably, the critical role that Hong Kong has played so far in propping up the Chinese economy will dramatically decline. Why does Beijing feel so threatened by Hong Kong? China has a territory of 9.3 million square kilometers and a population of 1.4 billion. Hong Kong has 1,100 square kilometers and 7.5 million inhabitants. How can such a small city be so threatening to such a giant country? Because China has a growing appetite for world hegemony. For a long time, Chinese authorities have insisted that the rest of the world had nothing to fear from its economic boom or its growing international influence. The national priority, they said, was to lift as many citizens out of poverty as quickly as possible. It was not in China’s plans to become the dominant player on the world stage. Lately, however, signs are emerging that China’s economic success has whetted the geopolitical appetites of Beijing’s leaders. Taking control of Hong Kong is just one of those signs. More are coming. @moisesnaim ",['Moisés Naím']
